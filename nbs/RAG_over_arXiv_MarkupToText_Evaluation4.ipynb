Notably, fine-tuning with DPO exceeds PPO-based RLHF in ability to control sentiment of generations, and matches or improves response quality in summarization and single-turn dialogue while being substantially simpler to implement and train.\\n1 Introduction\\nLarge unsupervised language models (LMs) trained on very large datasets',\n",
              " '1 Introduction\\nLarge unsupervised language models (LMs) trained on very large datasets\\nacquire surprising capabilities\\xa0(Chowdhery et\\xa0al., 2022; Brown et\\xa0al., 2020b; Touvron et\\xa0al., 2023; Bubeck et\\xa0al., 2023). However, these models are trained on data generated by humans with a wide variety of goals, priorities, and skillsets. Some of these goals and skillsets may not be desirable to imitate; for example, while we may want our AI coding assistant to understand common programming mistakes in order to correct them, nevertheless, when generating code, we would like to bias our model toward the (potentially rare) high-quality coding ability present in its training data. Similarly, we might want our language model to be aware of a common misconception believed by 50% of people, but we certainly do not want the model to claim this misconception to be true in 50% of queries about it! In other words, selecting the model’s desired responses and behavior from its very wide knowledge and abilities is crucial to building AI systems that are safe, performant, and controllable (Ouyang et\\xa0al., 2022). While existing methods typically steer LMs to match human preferences using reinforcement learning (RL), we will show that the RL-based objective used by existing methods can be optimized exactly with a simple binary cross-entropy objective, greatly simplifying the preference learning pipeline.\\nFigure 1: DPO optimizes for human preferences while avoiding reinforcement learning. Existing methods for fine-tuning language models with human feedback first fit a reward model to a dataset of prompts and human preferences over pairs of responses, and then use RL to find a policy that maximizes the learned reward. In contrast, DPO directly optimizes for the policy best satisfying the preferences with a simple classification objective, fitting an implicit reward model whose corresponding optimal policy can be extracted in closed form.',\n",
              " 'At a high level, existing methods instill the desired behaviors into a language model using curated sets of human preferences representing the types of behaviors that humans find safe and helpful. This preference learning stage occurs after an initial stage of large-scale unsupervised pre-training on a large text dataset. While the most straightforward approach to preference learning is supervised fine-tuning on human demonstrations of high quality responses, the most successful class of methods is reinforcement learning from human (or AI) feedback (RLHF/RLAIF; (Christiano et\\xa0al., 2017; Bai et\\xa0al., 2022b)). RLHF methods fit a reward model to a dataset of human preferences and then use RL to optimize a language model policy to produce responses assigned high reward without drifting excessively far from the original model. While RLHF produces models with impressive conversational and coding abilities, the RLHF pipeline is considerably more complex than supervised learning, involving training multiple LMs and sampling from the LM policy in the loop of training, incurring significant computational costs.\\nIn this paper, we show how to directly optimize a language model to adhere to human preferences, without explicit reward modeling or reinforcement learning.\\nWe propose',\n",
              " 'In this paper, we show how to directly optimize a language model to adhere to human preferences, without explicit reward modeling or reinforcement learning.\\nWe propose\\nDirect Preference Optimization (DPO), an algorithm that implicitly optimizes the same objective as existing RLHF algorithms (reward maximization with a KL-divergence constraint) but is simple to implement and straightforward to train. Intuitively, the DPO update increases the relative log probability of preferred to dispreferred responses, but it incorporates a dynamic, per-example importance weight that prevents the model degeneration that we find occurs with a naive probability ratio objective. Like existing algorithms, DPO relies on a theoretical preference model (such as the Bradley-Terry model; Bradley and Terry (1952)) that measures how well a given reward function aligns with empirical preference data. However, while existing methods use the preference model to define a preference loss to train a reward model and then train a policy that optimizes the learned reward model, DPO uses a change of variables to define the preference loss as a function of the policy directly. Given a dataset of human preferences over model responses, DPO can therefore optimize a policy using a simple binary cross entropy objective, producing the optimal policy to an implicit reward function fit to the preference data.\\nOur main contribution is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a simple RL-free algorithm for training language models from preferences. Our experiments show that DPO is at least as effective as existing methods, including PPO-based RLHF, for learning from preferences in tasks such as sentiment modulation, summarization, and dialogue, using language models with up to 6B parameters.\\n2 Related Work',\n",

However, their performance on downstream tasks and alignment with user intent can be significantly improved by fine-tuning on datasets of instructions and human-written completions (Mishra et\\xa0al., 2022; Sanh et\\xa0al., 2022; Chung et\\xa0al., 2022; Thoppilan et\\xa0al., 2022). This ‘instruction-tuning’ procedure',\n",
              " 'enables LLMs to generalize to instructions outside of the instruction-tuning set and generally increase their usability (Chung et\\xa0al., 2022). Despite the success of instruction tuning, relative human judgments of response quality are often easier to collect than expert demonstrations, and thus subsequent works have fine-tuned LLMs with datasets of human preferences, improving proficiency in translation (Kreutzer et\\xa0al., 2018), summarization (Stiennon et\\xa0al., 2022; Ziegler et\\xa0al., 2020), story-telling (Ziegler et\\xa0al., 2020), and instruction-following (Ouyang et\\xa0al., 2022; Ramamurthy et\\xa0al., 2023). These methods first optimize a neural network reward function for compatibility with the dataset of preferences under a preference model such as the Bradley-Terry model (Bradley and Terry, 1952), then fine-tune a language model to maximize the given reward using reinforcement learning algorithms, commonly REINFORCE (Williams, 1992), proximal policy optimization (PPO; Schulman et\\xa0al. (2017)), or variants (Ramamurthy et\\xa0al., 2023). A closely-related line of work leverages LLMs fine-tuned for instruction following with human feedback to generate additional synthetic preference data for targeted attributes such as safety or harmlessness (Bai et\\xa0al., 2022b), using only weak supervision from humans in the form of a text rubric for the LLM’s annotations. These methods represent a convergence of two bodies of work: one body of work on training language models with reinforcement learning for a variety of objectives\\xa0(Ranzato et\\xa0al., 2015; Paulus et\\xa0al., 2018; Wu and Hu, 2018) and another body of work on general methods for learning from human preferences (Christiano et\\xa0al., 2017; Kupcsik et\\xa0al., 2018).\\nDespite the appeal of using relative human preferences, fine-tuning large language models with reinforcement learning remains a major practical challenge; this work provides a theoretically-justified approach to optimizing relative preferences without RL.',\n",
              " 'Outside of the context of language, learning policies from preferences has been studied in both bandit and reinforcement learning settings, and several approaches have been proposed. Contextual bandit learning using preferences or rankings of actions, rather than rewards, is known as a contextual dueling bandit (CDB; Yue et\\xa0al. (2012); Dudík et\\xa0al. (2015)). In the absence of absolute rewards, theoretical analysis of CDBs substitutes the notion of an optimal policy with a von Neumann winner, a policy whose expected win rate against any other policy is at least 50% (Dudík et\\xa0al., 2015). However, in the CDB setting, preference labels are given online, while in learning from human preferences, we typically learn from a fixed batch of offline preference-annotated action pairs (Yan et\\xa0al., 2022). Similarly, preference-based RL (PbRL) learns from binary preferences generated by an unknown ‘scoring’ function rather than rewards (Busa-Fekete et\\xa0al., 2014; Saha et\\xa0al., 2023). Various algorithms for PbRL exist, including methods that can reuse off-policy preference data, but generally involve first explicitly estimating the latent scoring function (i.e. the reward model) and subsequently optimizing it (Jain et\\xa0al., 2013; Busa-Fekete et\\xa0al., 2014; Christiano et\\xa0al., 2017; Sadigh et\\xa0al., 2017; Kupcsik et\\xa0al., 2018). We instead present a single stage policy learning approach that directly optimizes a policy to satisfy preferences.\\n3 Preliminaries\\nWe review the RLHF pipeline in Ziegler et\\xa0al. (and later (Stiennon et\\xa0al., 2022; Bai et\\xa0al., 2022a; Ouyang et\\xa0al., 2022)). It usually includes three phases: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT); 2) preference sampling and reward learning and 3) RL optimization.\\nSFT: RLHF typically begins by fine-tuning a pre-trained LM with supervised learning on high-quality data for the downstream task(s) of interest (dialogue, summarization, etc.), to obtain a model πSFTsuperscript𝜋SFT\\\\pi^{\\\\text{SFT}}italic_π start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT SFT end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT.',\n",

We can state the following two lemmas:\\nLemma 1.\\nUnder the Plackett-Luce, and in particular the Bradley-Terry, preference framework, two reward functions from the same class induce the same preference distribution.\\nLemma 2.\\nTwo reward functions from the same equivalence class induce the same optimal policy under the constrained RL problem.\\nThe proofs are straightforward and we defer them to Appendix A.5. The first lemma is a well-known under-specification issue with the Plackett-Luce family of models Plackett (1975). Due to this under-specification, we usually have to impose additional identifiability constraints to achieve any guarantees on the MLE estimates from Eq. 2 Bong and Rinaldo (2022). The second lemma states that all reward functions from the same class yield the same optimal policy, hence for our final objective, we are only interested in recovering an arbitrary reward function from the optimal class.

First, in a well-controlled text-generation setting, we ask: how efficiently does DPO trade off maximizing reward and minimizing KL-divergence with the reference policy, compared to common preference learning algorithms such as PPO? Next, we evaluate DPO’s performance on larger models and more difficult RLHF tasks, including summarization and dialogue. We find that with almost no tuning of hyperparameters, DPO tends to perform as well or better than strong baselines like RLHF with PPO as well as returning the best of N𝑁Nitalic_N sampled trajectories under a learned reward function.

However, in the real world, the ground truth reward function is not known; therefore, we evaluate algorithms with their win rate against a baseline policy, using GPT-4 as a proxy for human evaluation of summary quality and response helpfulness in the summarization and single-turn dialogue settings, respectively. For summarization, we use reference summaries in the test set as the baseline; for dialogue, we use the preferred response in the test dataset as the baseline. While existing studies suggest LMs can be better automated evaluators than existing metrics (Chen et\\xa0al., 2023), we conduct a human study to justify our usage of GPT-4 for evaluation in Sec.\\xa06.4.

For this new distribution, DPO continues to outperform the PPO policy by a significant margin. This experiment provides initial evidence that DPO policies can generalize similarly well to PPO policies, even though DPO does not use the additional unlabeled Reddit TL;DR prompts that PPO uses.\\n6.4 Validating GPT-4 judgments with human judgments\\nWe conduct a human study to verify the reliability of GPT-4’s judgments, using the results of the TL;DR summarization experiment and two different GPT-4 prompts. The GPT-4 (S) (simple) prompt simply asks for which summary better-summarizes the important information in the post. The GPT-4 (C) (concise) prompt also asks for which summary is more concise; we evaluate this prompt because we find that GPT-4 prefers longer, more repetitive summaries than humans do with the GPT-4 (S) prompt. See Appendix\\xa0C.2 for the complete prompts. We perform three comparisons, using the highest (DPO, temp. 0.25), the lowest (PPO, temp. 1.0), and a\\nDPO\\nSFT\\nPPO-1\\nN respondents\\n272\\n122\\n199\\nGPT-4 (S) win %\\n47\\n27\\n13\\nGPT-4 (C) win %\\n54\\n32\\n12\\nHuman win %\\n58\\n43\\n17\\nGPT-4 (S)-H agree\\n70\\n77\\n86\\nGPT-4 (C)-H agree\\n67\\n79\\n85\\nH-H agree\\n65\\n-\\n87',\n",

              " '7 Discussion\\nLearning from preferences is a powerful, scalable framework for training capable, aligned language models. We have introduced DPO, a simple training paradigm for training language models from preferences without reinforcement learning. Rather than coercing the preference learning problem into a standard RL setting in order to use off-the-shelf RL algorithms, DPO identifies a mapping between language model policies and reward functions that enables training a language model to satisfy human preferences directly, with a simple cross-entropy loss, without reinforcement learning or loss of generality. With virtually no tuning of hyperparameters, DPO performs similarly or better than existing RLHF algorithms, including those based on PPO; DPO thus meaningfully reduces the barrier to training more language models from human preferences.',\n",
              " 'Limitations & Future Work. Our results raise several important questions for future work. How does the DPO policy generalize out of distribution, compared with learning from an explicit reward function? Our initial results suggest that DPO policies can generalize similarly to PPO-based models, but more comprehensive study is needed. For example, can training with self-labeling from the DPO policy similarly make effective use of unlabeled prompts? On another front, how does reward over-optimization manifest in the direct preference optimization setting, and is the slight decrease in performance in Figure\\xa03-right an instance of it? Additionally, while we evaluate models up to 6B parameters, exploration of scaling DPO to state-of-the-art models orders of magnitude larger is an exciting direction for future work. Regarding evaluations, we find that the win rates computed by GPT-4 are impacted by the prompt; future work may study the best way to elicit high-quality judgments from automated systems. Finally, many possible applications of DPO exist beyond training language models from human preferences, including training generative models in other modalities.\\nAcknowledgements\\nEM gratefully acknowledges funding from a Knight-Hennessy Graduate Fellowship.

This preference learning stage occurs after an initial stage of large-scale unsupervised pre-training on a large text dataset.

Intuitively, the DPO update increases the relative log probability of preferred to dispreferred responses, but it incorporates a dynamic, per-example importance weight that prevents the model degeneration that we find occurs with a naive probability ratio objective. Like existing algorithms, DPO relies on a theoretical preference model (such as the Bradley-Terry model; Bradley and Terry (1952)) that measures how well a given reward function aligns with empirical preference data. However, while existing methods use the preference model to define a preference loss to train a reward model and then train a policy that optimizes the learned reward model, DPO uses a change of variables to define the preference loss as a function of the policy directly. Given a dataset of human preferences over model responses, DPO can therefore optimize a policy using a simple binary cross entropy objective, producing the optimal policy to an implicit reward function fit to the preference data.\\nOur main contribution is Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a simple RL-free algorithm for training language models from preferences.

These methods first optimize a neural network reward function for compatibility with the dataset of preferences under a preference model such as the Bradley-Terry model (Bradley and Terry, 1952), then fine-tune a language model to maximize the given reward using reinforcement learning algorithms, commonly REINFORCE (Williams, 1992), proximal policy optimization (PPO; Schulman et\\xa0al.

Contextual bandit learning using preferences or rankings of actions, rather than rewards, is known as a contextual dueling bandit (CDB; Yue et\\xa0al. (2012); Dudík et\\xa0al. (2015)). In the absence of absolute rewards, theoretical analysis of CDBs substitutes the notion of an optimal policy with a von Neumann winner, a policy whose expected win rate against any other policy is at least 50% (Dudík et\\xa0al., 2015). However, in the CDB setting, preference labels are given online, while in learning from human preferences, we typically learn from a fixed batch of offline preference-annotated action pairs (Yan et\\xa0al., 2022). Similarly, preference-based RL (PbRL) learns from binary preferences generated by an unknown ‘scoring’ function rather than rewards (Busa-Fekete et\\xa0al., 2014; Saha et\\xa0al., 2023). Various algorithms for PbRL exist, including methods that can reuse off-policy preference data, but generally involve first explicitly estimating the latent scoring function (i.e. the reward model) and subsequently optimizing it (Jain et\\xa0al., 2013; Busa-Fekete et\\xa0al., 2014; Christiano et\\xa0al., 2017; Sadigh et\\xa0al., 2017; Kupcsik et\\xa0al., 2018).

First, DPO and PPO optimize the same objective, but DPO is notably more efficient; DPO’s reward/KL tradeoff strictly dominates PPO. Second, DPO achieves a better frontier than PPO, even when PPO can access ground truth rewards (PPO-GT).\\n6.2 Can DPO scale to real preference datasets?\\nNext, we evaluate fine-tuning performance of DPO on summarization and single-turn dialogue.

As there is no standard SFT model for this task, we start with a pre-trained Pythia-2.8B, use Preferred-FT to train a reference model on the chosen completions such that completions are within distribution of the model, and then train using DPO. We also compare against the best of 128 Preferred-FT completions (we found the Best of N𝑁Nitalic_N baseline plateaus at 128 completions for this task; see Appendix Figure\\xa04) and a 2-shot prompted version of the Pythia-2.8B base model, finding DPO performs as well or better for the best-performing temperatures for each method.

Overall, DPO is the only computationally efficient method that improves over the preferred completions in the Anthropic HH dataset, and provides similar or better performance to the computationally demanding Best of 128 baseline.

This experiment provides initial evidence that DPO policies can generalize similarly well to PPO policies, even though DPO does not use the additional unlabeled Reddit TL;DR prompts that PPO uses.\\n6.4 Validating GPT-4 judgments with human judgments\\nWe conduct a human study to verify the reliability of GPT-4’s judgments, using the results of the TL;DR summarization experiment and two different GPT-4 prompts.

The GPT-4 (C) (concise) prompt also asks for which summary is more concise; we evaluate this prompt because we find that GPT-4 prefers longer, more repetitive summaries than humans do with the GPT-4 (S) prompt. See Appendix\\xa0C.2 for the complete prompts.

              " Document(page_content='7 Discussion\\nLearning from preferences is a powerful, scalable framework for training capable, aligned language models. We have introduced DPO, a simple training paradigm for training language models from preferences without reinforcement learning. Rather than coercing the preference learning problem into a standard RL setting in order to use off-the-shelf RL algorithms, DPO identifies a mapping between language model policies and reward functions that enables training a language model to satisfy human preferences directly, with a simple cross-entropy loss, without reinforcement learning or loss of generality. With virtually no tuning of hyperparameters, DPO performs similarly or better than existing RLHF algorithms, including those based on PPO; DPO thus meaningfully reduces the barrier to training more language models from human preferences.'),\n",
              " Document(page_content='Limitations & Future Work. Our results raise several important questions for future work. How does the DPO policy generalize out of distribution, compared with learning from an explicit reward function? Our initial results suggest that DPO policies can generalize similarly to PPO-based models, but more comprehensive study is needed. For example, can training with self-labeling from the DPO policy similarly make effective use of unlabeled prompts? On another front, how does reward over-optimization manifest in the direct preference optimization setting, and is the slight decrease in performance in Figure\\xa03-right an instance of it? Additionally, while we evaluate models up to 6B parameters, exploration of scaling DPO to state-of-the-art models orders of magnitude larger is an exciting direction for future work. Regarding evaluations, we find that the win rates computed by GPT-4 are impacted by the prompt; future work may study the best way to elicit high-quality judgments from automated systems. Finally, many possible applications of DPO exist beyond training language models from human preferences, including training generative models in other modalities.\\nAcknowledgements\\nEM gratefully acknowledges funding from a Knight-Hennessy Graduate Fellowship.

            "Existing methods for gaining such steerability collect human labels of the relative quality of model generations and fine-tune the unsupervised LM to align with these preferences, often with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).\n",
            "However, RLHF is a complex and often unstable procedure, first fitting a reward model that reflects the human preferences, and then fine-tuning the large unsupervised LM using reinforcement learning to maximize this estimated reward without drifting too far from the original model.\n",
            "In this paper we introduce a new parameterization of the reward model in RLHF that enables extraction of the corresponding optimal policy in closed form, allowing us to solve the standard RLHF problem with only a simple classification loss.\n",
            "The resulting algorithm, which we call Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), is stable, performant, and computationally lightweight, eliminating the need for  sampling from the LM during fine-tuning or performing significant hyperparameter tuning.\n",

We conduct a set of ablations of our framework to identify which factors play\\nkey roles. We evaluate two model variants trained differently than our model: No Retriever trains an\\nLM using the standard instruction-following method given instruction-output pairs, without retrieved\\npassages; No Critic trains an LM trained with input-output pairs that are always augmented with the\\ntop one retrieved document without reflection tokens. This is similar to SAIL (Luo et al., 2023), and\\nwe use our instruction-output data instead of using the Alpaca dataset (Dubois et al., 2023), as in\\nSAIL. We also conduct ablation on our inference-time algorithm, including No retrieval disables\\nretrieval during inference; Hard constraints indicates the model performance that retrieves when\\nRetrieve =Yes instead of using the adaptive threshold; Retrieve top 1 always retrieves and uses the\\ntop one document only, similar to standard RAG approaches; Remove ISSUPindicates the model\\nperformance that removes ISSUPscore only during critique-guided beam search in Eq. 4. In this\\nablation experiment, we use a training instance size of 50k for a more efficient exploration of trainingDocument 1:::\\noutput is supported by the cited evidence). Human annotators find SELF-RAGanswers are often\\nplausible and supported by relevant passages with higher S&P scores on short-form PopQA, which is\\nconsistent with Menick et al. (2022). Human annotators also find ISRELand ISSUPreflection token\\npredictions are mostly aligned with their assessments. Appendix Table 6 shows several annotated\\nexamples and explanations on assessments.\\n6 C ONCLUSION\\nThis work introduces SELF-RAG, a new framework to enhance the quality and factuality of LLMs\\nthrough retrieval on demand and self-reflection. SELF-RAGtrains an LM to learn to retrieve, generate,\\nand critique text passages and its own generation by predicting the next tokens from its original\\nvocabulary as well as newly added special tokens, called reflection tokens. SELF-RAGfurther enables\\nthe tailoring of LM behaviors at test time by leveraging reflection tokens. Our holistic evaluations on\\nsix tasks using multiple metrics demonstrate that SELF-RAGsignificantly outperforms LLMs with\\nmore parameters or with conventional retrieval-augmented generation approaches.\\n10Preprint.\\nETHICAL CONCERNS\\nThis work aims to improve the factuality of LLM outputs, the lack of which continues to cause nu-\\nmerous real-world problems (e.g., spread of misinformation and provision of incorrect and dangerous\\nadvice). While our method shows significant improvements in terms of performance, factuality, and\\ncitation accuracy, it can still generate outputs that are not fully supported by the citations. We hope\\nthat explicit self-reflection and fine-grained attribution may help users verify factual errors in the\\nmodel outputs.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe thank Sewon Min, Scott Wen-tau Yih, Sean Welleck, and Kawin Ethayarajh for fruitful discussions\\nin the early stages of this work.

Our end-to-end training\\nlets an LM Mgenerate text informed by retrieved passages, if needed, and criticize the output by\\nlearning to generate special tokens. These reflection tokens (Table 1) signal the need for retrieval\\nor confirm the output’s relevance, support, or completeness.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad\\nhoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases\\nsuch issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number\\nof retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are\\nrelevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation.\\nWe introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Gen-\\neration ( SELF-RAG)that enhances an LM’s quality and factuality through retrieval\\nand self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively\\nretrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages\\nand its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens. Generating\\nreflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it\\nto tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that SELF-\\nRAG(7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs\\nand retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, SELF-RAG\\noutperforms ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain QA,\\nreasoning and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving\\nfactuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.1\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nState-of-the-art LLMs continue to struggle with factual errors (Mallen et al., 2023; Min et al., 2023)Document 6:::\\nEffects of training data size. We conduct an analysis of how the data scale affects the model’s\\nperformance. In particular, we randomly sample 5k, 10k, 20k, and 50k instances from our original\\n150k training instances, and fine-tune four SELF-RAG 7Bvariants on those subsets. Then, we compare\\nthe model performance on PopQA, PubHealth, and ASQA (citation precision) with our final SELF-\\nRAGtrained on the full 150k instances. We also evaluate Figures 4a, 4b and 4c shows the models’\\nperformance trained on different amount of data. Across all datasets, increasing data size often shows\\nupward trajectories and the improvements are significantly larger in PopQA and ASQA, while we do\\nnot observed such significant improvements on Llama2-FT 7Bwhen increasing the training data from\\n50k to 150k. These results also indicate that further expanding the training data of SELF-RAGmay\\nlead to further improvements, although in this work we limit our training data size to 150k.\\nHuman evaluations. We conduct small human evaluations on SELF-RAGoutputs, as well as the\\nreliability of predicted reflection tokens. In particular, we sampled 50 samples from PopQA and Bio\\nresults. Following Menick et al. (2022), human annotators evaluate S&P , which indicates whether\\nthe model output is plausible (i.e., the output is a reasonable and on-topic response to the question\\nas if it were occurring in a conversation) and supported (i.e., the provided evidence is sufficient to\\nverify the validity of the answer). For S&P, we do not consider the instances where SELF-RAG\\npredicts irrelevant orno support . We then ask our annotators whether the model-predicted\\nreflection tokens about ISRELand ISSUPmatch their inspections (e.g., whether the fully supported\\noutput is supported by the cited evidence). Human annotators find SELF-RAGanswers are often\\nplausible and supported by relevant passages with higher S&P scores on short-form PopQA, which isDocument 7:::\\nAlgorithm 1 SELF-RAGInference\\nRequire: Generator LM M, Retriever R, Large-scale passage collections {d1, . . . , d N}\\n1:Input: input prompt xand preceding generation y<t,Output: next output segment yt\\n2:Mpredicts Retrieve given (x, y<t)\\n3:ifRetrieve ==Yes then\\n4: Retrieve relevant text passages DusingRgiven (x, yt−1) ▷Retrieve\\n5: Mpredicts ISRELgiven x, dandytgiven x, d, y <tfor each d∈D ▷Generate\\n6: Mpredicts ISSUPand ISUSEgiven x, yt, dfor each d∈D ▷Critique\\n7: Rank ytbased on ISREL,ISSUP,ISUSE ▷Detailed in Section 3.3\\n8:else if Retrieve ==Nothen\\n9: Mgenpredicts ytgiven x ▷ Generate\\n10: Mgenpredicts ISUSEgiven x, yt ▷Critique\\nInference overview.

Finally, a new critique token evaluates the overall\\nutility of the response.4To generate each segment, SELF-RAGprocesses multiple passages in parallel\\nand uses its own generated reflection tokens to enforce soft constraints (Section 3.3) or hard control\\n(Algorithm 1) over the generated task output.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\n(RAG) methods (Figure 1 left; Lewis et al. 2020; Guu et al. 2020) augment the input of LLMs\\nwith relevant retrieved passages, reducing factual errors in knowledge-intensive tasks (Ram et al.,\\n2023; Asai et al., 2023a). However, these methods may hinder the versatility of LLMs or introduce\\nunnecessary or off-topic passages that lead to low-quality generations (Shi et al., 2023) since they\\nretrieve passages indiscriminately regardless of whether the factual grounding is helpful. Moreover,\\nthe output is not guaranteed to be consistent with retrieved relevant passages (Gao et al., 2023) since\\nthe models are not explicitly trained to leverage and follow facts from provided passages. This\\nwork introduces Self-Reflective Retrieval-augmented Generation ( SELF-RAG)to improve an\\nLLM’s generation quality, including its factual accuracy without hurting its versatility, via on-demand\\nretrieval and self-reflection. We train an arbitrary LM in an end-to-end manner to learn to reflect on\\nits own generation process given a task input by generating both task output and intermittent special\\ntokens (i.e., reflection tokens ). Reflection tokens are categorized into retrieval andcritique tokens to\\nindicate the need for retrieval and its generation quality respectively (Figure 1 right). In particular,\\ngiven an input prompt and preceding generations, SELF-RAGfirst determines if augmenting the\\ncontinued generation with retrieved passages would be helpful. If so, it outputs a retrieval token that\\ncalls a retriever model on demand (Step 1). Subsequently, SELF-RAGconcurrently processes multiple\\nretrieved passages, evaluating their relevance and then generating corresponding task outputs (StepDocument 9:::\\nPrompt: Write an essay of your best summer vacation\\nPrompt: Write an essay of your best summer vacation\\nNo RetrievalMy best summer vacation is when my family and I embarked on a road trip along …My best… \\n>Repeat.…\\nNo information in passagesContradictory>Prompt +  \\nPrompt +  \\nRetrieve\\nFigure 1: Overview of SELF-RAG.SELF-RAGlearns to retrieve, critique, and generate text passages\\nto enhance overall generation quality, factuality, and verifiability.\\nconsistently retrieves a fixed number of documents for generation regardless of the retrieval necessity\\n(e.g., the bottom figure example does not require factual knowledge) and never second visits the\\ngeneration quality.

We train our generator LM on a diverse\\ncollection of text interleaved with reflection tokens and retrieved passages. Reflection tokens, inspired\\nby reward models used in reinforcement learning (Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022), are\\ninserted offline into the original corpus by a trained critic model. This eliminates the need to host a\\ncritic model during training, reducing overhead. The critic model, in part, is supervised on a dataset\\nof input, output, and corresponding reflection tokens collected by prompting a propriety LM (i.e.,\\nGPT-4; OpenAI 2023). While we draw inspiration from studies that use control tokens to start and\\nguide text generation (Lu et al., 2022; Keskar et al., 2019), our trained LM uses critique tokens to\\nassess its own predictions after each generated segment as an integral part of the generation output.\\nSELF-RAGfurther enables a customizable decoding algorithm to satisfy hard or soft constraints,\\n---\\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\\n\\nQuestion: What is the difference between RAG and self-RAG?\\n</s>\\n<|assistant|>\\nRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an ad hoc approach that augments large language models (LLMs) with the retrieval of relevant knowledge to decrease factual errors.
