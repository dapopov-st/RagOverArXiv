One of the major causes of the high generation latency is the\\nsequential decoding approach adopted by almost all state-of-the-art LLMs. In\\nthis work, motivated by the thinking and writing process of humans, we propose\\nSkeleton-of-Thought (SoT) , which first guides LLMs to generate the skeleton of\\nthe answer, and then conducts parallel API calls or batched decoding to com-\\nplete the contents of each skeleton point in parallel . Not only does SoT provide\\nconsiderable speed-ups across 12 LLMs, but it can also potentially improve the\\nanswer quality on several question categories. SoT is an initial attempt at data-\\ncentric optimization for inference efficiency, and further underscores the potential\\nof pushing LLMs to think more like a human for answer quality.\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nLarge language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a; Du et al., 2022; OpenAI,\\n2023; Zheng et al., 2023) have shown exceptional performance in natural language processing and\\nchatbot systems. However, the inference process of the state-of-the-art LLMs is slow, hindering their\\ninteractive use. For example, it takes 22 seconds for Claude (Anthropic, 2023) (accessed through\\nSlack API) and 43 seconds for Vicuna-33B V1.3 (a 33B LLaMA-based model, running locally on\\none NVIDIA A100 GPU) to answer the question in Fig. 1.',\n",

Note that we strip newlines in\\nthe examples and generations in order to present them on one page. At one point an unprintable\\ncharacter (btyes U+FFFD) was produced, which we write as (U+FFFD). We have two settings for the\\nexamples.\\nIn the first setting, we take the prompt sequence and change the last token to a random token\\ndrawn from the dataset. We see that the SequenceMatch model is able to utilize the <backspace>\\ntoken immediately to remove the spurious token. The only case where this does not happen is for\\nthe prompt ...

However, this maximum-likelihood (MLE)\\nobjective does not necessarily match a downstream use-case of autoregressively\\ngenerating high-quality sequences. The MLE objective weights sequences propor-\\ntionally to their frequency under the data distribution, with no guidance for the\\nmodel‚Äôs behaviour out of distribution (OOD): leading to compounding error during\\nautoregressive generation. In order to address this compounding error problem, we\\nformulate sequence generation as an imitation learning (IL) problem. This allows\\nus to minimize a variety of divergences between the distribution of sequences\\ngenerated by an autoregressive model and sequences from a dataset, including\\ndivergences with weight on OOD generated sequences. The IL framework also\\nallows us to incorporate backtracking by introducing a backspace action into\\nthe generation process. This further mitigates the compounding error problem by\\nallowing the model to revert a sampled token if it takes the sequence OOD. Our\\nresulting method, SequenceMatch, can be implemented without adversarial training\\nor architectural changes.

This has led to a failure rate of 88% for North Korea\\'s version of the Soviet-era missile on which it is based, compared to a 13% failure rate for the original Soviet missile. US Deputy National Security Adviser K.T.

The algorithm first generates dense attention weights for each token in the input sequence, which captures the relative importance of each token to the output. Then, it applies sparse attention to select a subset of tokens that are most relevant to the output, based on their dense attention weights. The final output is a weighted sum of the input tokens, where the weights are determined by the sparse attention mechanism. This approach allows the model to selectively focus on different parts of the input sequence, depending on the specific task and context.',\n",

While one can reduce the overall latency by pruning layers or exploit-\\ning multi-task settings (R ¬®uckl¬¥e et al., 2020; Pfeiffer et al., 2021), there is no direct ways to bypass\\nthe extra compute in adapter layers.

This approach en-\\nables combining arbitrary LLM thoughts into synergistic out-\\ncomes, distilling the essence of whole networks of thoughts,\\nor enhancing thoughts using feedback loops. We illustrate\\nthat GoT offers advantages over state of the art on different\\ntasks, for example increasing the quality of sorting by 62%\\nover ToT, while simultaneously reducing costs by >31%.\\nWe ensure that GoT is extensible with new thought transfor-\\nmations and thus can be used to spearhead new prompting\\nschemes. This work brings the LLM reasoning closer to hu-\\nman thinking or brain mechanisms such as recurrence, both\\nof which form complex networks.\\nWebsite & code: https://github.com/spcl/graph-of-thoughts\\n1 Introduction\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are taking over the world\\nof AI.

              "  'answer': 'The ability to model information generated by an LLM as an arbitrary graph in Graph of Thoughts enables synergistic outcomes and enhances thoughts by allowing units of information, or LLM thoughts, to be combined in arbitrary ways. This enables the distillation of the essence of whole networks of thoughts and the use of feedback loops to improve the quality of the output. This approach is more flexible and powerful than other paradigms such as Chain-of-Thought or Tree of Thoughts (ToT), which limit the way in which LLM thoughts can be combined. By enabling more complex and nuanced combinations of LLM thoughts, Graph of Thoughts brings LLM reasoning closer to human thinking or brain mechanisms such as recurrence.',\n",

Finally, we discuss the sandbox environ-\\nment we used to safely execute model-generated code.\\n2.1. Functional Correctness\\nGenerative models for code are predominantly benchmarked\\nby matching samples against a reference solution, where\\nthe match can be exact or fuzzy (as in BLEU score). How-\\never, recent work has surfaced deÔ¨Åciencies in match-based\\nmetrics for code. For instance, Ren et al. (2020) Ô¨Ånds that\\nBLEU has problems capturing semantic features speciÔ¨Åc\\nto code, and suggests several semantic modiÔ¨Åcations to the\\nscore.\\nMore fundamentally, match-based metrics are unable to ac-\\ncount for the large and complex space of programs function-\\nally equivalent to a reference solution. As a consequence,\\nrecent works in unsupervised code translation (Lachaux\\net al., 2020) and pseudocode-to-code translation (Kulal et al.,\\n2019) have turned to functional correctness instead, where\\na sample is considered correct if it passes a set of unit tests.\\nWe argue that this metric should be applied to docstring-\\nconditional code generation as well.\\nPerhaps the most convincing reason to evaluate functional\\ncorrectness is that it is used by human developers to judge\\ncode. A framework known as test-driven development dic-\\ntates that software requirements be converted into test cases\\nbefore any implementation begins, and success is deÔ¨Åned\\nby a program that passes these tests. While few organiza-\\ntions employ full test-driven development, integration of\\nnew code is usually dependent on creating and passing unit\\ntests.\\nKulal et al.

This enables the distillation of the essence of whole networks of thoughts and the use of feedback loops to improve the quality of the output. This approach is more flexible and powerful than other paradigms such as Chain-of-Thought or Tree of Thoughts (ToT), which limit the way in which LLM thoughts can be combined. By enabling more complex and nuanced combinations of LLM thoughts, Graph of Thoughts brings LLM reasoning closer to human thinking or brain mechanisms such as recurrence.   \n",

Additionally, when outputting from the oracle best DFS state, ToT performance is even higher and actually solves 7/20 games, indicating that the simple output heuristics used can be improved.

This enables the distillation of the essence of whole networks of thoughts and the use of feedback loops to improve the quality of the output. This approach is more flexible and powerful than other paradigms such as Chain-of-Thought or Tree of Thoughts (ToT), which limit the way in which LLM thoughts can be combined.

These thoughts are then evaluated based on the possibility of filling in each remaining word clue, and pruned if any remaining clue is deemed not possible to fill by the LM. The remaining thoughts are then sorted in a priority queue based on their evaluation scores, and the algorithm explores the next promising thought for clue in the priority queue.

We evaluate two model variants trained differently than our model: No Retriever trains an\\nLM using the standard instruction-following method given instruction-output pairs, without retrieved\\npassages; No Critic trains an LM trained with input-output pairs that are always augmented with the\\ntop one retrieved document without reflection tokens. This is similar to SAIL (Luo et al., 2023), and\\nwe use our instruction-output data instead of using the Alpaca dataset (Dubois et al., 2023), as in\\nSAIL. We also conduct ablation on our inference-time algorithm, including No retrieval disables\\nretrieval during inference; Hard constraints indicates the model performance that retrieves when\\nRetrieve =Yes instead of using the adaptive threshold; Retrieve top 1 always retrieves and uses the\\ntop one document only, similar to standard RAG approaches; Remove ISSUPindicates the model\\nperformance that removes ISSUPscore only during critique-guided beam search in Eq. 4.

SELF-RAGtrains an LM to learn to retrieve, generate,\\nand critique text passages and its own generation by predicting the next tokens from its original\\nvocabulary as well as newly added special tokens, called reflection tokens. SELF-RAGfurther enables\\nthe tailoring of LM behaviors at test time by leveraging reflection tokens. Our holistic evaluations on\\nsix tasks using multiple metrics demonstrate that SELF-RAGsignificantly outperforms LLMs with\\nmore parameters or with conventional retrieval-augmented generation approaches.\\n10Preprint.\\nETHICAL CONCERNS\\nThis work aims to improve the factuality of LLM outputs, the lack of which continues to cause nu-\\nmerous real-world problems (e.g., spread of misinformation and provision of incorrect and dangerous\\nadvice). While our method shows significant improvements in terms of performance, factuality, and\\ncitation accuracy, it can still generate outputs that are not fully supported by the citations. We hope\\nthat explicit self-reflection and fine-grained attribution may help users verify factual errors in the\\nmodel outputs.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe thank Sewon Min, Scott Wen-tau Yih, Sean Welleck, and Kawin Ethayarajh for fruitful discussions\\nin the early stages of this work.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad\\nhoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases\\nsuch issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number\\nof retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are\\nrelevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation.\\nWe introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Gen-\\neration ( SELF-RAG)that enhances an LM‚Äôs quality and factuality through retrieval\\nand self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively\\nretrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages\\nand its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens. Generating\\nreflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it\\nto tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that SELF-\\nRAG(7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs\\nand retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, SELF-RAG\\noutperforms ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain QA,\\nreasoning and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving\\nfactuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.1\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nState-of-the-art LLMs continue to struggle with factual errors (Mallen et al., 2023; Min et al., 2023)Document 6:::\\nEffects of training data size. We conduct an analysis of how the data scale affects the model‚Äôs\\nperformance. In particular, we randomly sample 5k, 10k, 20k, and 50k instances from our original\\n150k training instances, and fine-tune four SELF-RAG 7Bvariants on those subsets. Then, we compare\\nthe model performance on PopQA, PubHealth, and ASQA (citation precision) with our final SELF-\\nRAGtrained on the full 150k instances. We also evaluate Figures 4a, 4b and 4c shows the models‚Äô\\nperformance trained on different amount of data. Across all datasets, increasing data size often shows\\nupward trajectories and the improvements are significantly larger in PopQA and ASQA, while we do\\nnot observed such significant improvements on Llama2-FT 7Bwhen increasing the training data from\\n50k to 150k. These results also indicate that further expanding the training data of SELF-RAGmay\\nlead to further improvements, although in this work we limit our training data size to 150k.\\nHuman evaluations. We conduct small human evaluations on SELF-RAGoutputs, as well as the\\nreliability of predicted reflection tokens. In particular, we sampled 50 samples from PopQA and Bio\\nresults. Following Menick et al. (2022), human annotators evaluate S&P , which indicates whether\\nthe model output is plausible (i.e., the output is a reasonable and on-topic response to the question\\nas if it were occurring in a conversation) and supported (i.e., the provided evidence is sufficient to\\nverify the validity of the answer). For S&P, we do not consider the instances where SELF-RAG\\npredicts irrelevant orno support . We then ask our annotators whether the model-predicted\\nreflection tokens about ISRELand ISSUPmatch their inspections (e.g., whether the fully supported\\noutput is supported by the cited evidence). Human annotators find SELF-RAGanswers are often\\nplausible and supported by relevant passages with higher S&P scores on short-form PopQA, which isDocument 7:::\\nAlgorithm 1 SELF-RAGInference\\nRequire: Generator LM M, Retriever R, Large-scale passage collections {d1, . . . , d N}\\n1:Input: input prompt xand preceding generation y<t,Output: next output segment yt\\n2:Mpredicts Retrieve given (x, y<t)\\n3:ifRetrieve ==Yes then\\n4: Retrieve relevant text passages DusingRgiven (x, yt‚àí1) ‚ñ∑Retrieve\\n5: Mpredicts ISRELgiven x, dandytgiven x, d, y <tfor each d‚ààD ‚ñ∑Generate\\n6: Mpredicts ISSUPand ISUSEgiven x, yt, dfor each d‚ààD ‚ñ∑Critique\\n7: Rank ytbased on ISREL,ISSUP,ISUSE ‚ñ∑Detailed in Section 3.3\\n8:else if Retrieve ==Nothen\\n9: Mgenpredicts ytgiven x ‚ñ∑ Generate\\n10: Mgenpredicts ISUSEgiven x, yt ‚ñ∑Critique\\nInference overview.

If retrieval is needed, the model generates: a critique token to evaluate the retrieved\\npassage‚Äôs relevance, the next response segment, and a critique token to evaluate if the information in\\nthe response segment is supported by the passage. Finally, a new critique token evaluates the overall\\nutility of the response.4To generate each segment, SELF-RAGprocesses multiple passages in parallel\\nand uses its own generated reflection tokens to enforce soft constraints (Section 3.3) or hard control\\n(Algorithm 1) over the generated task output.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\n(RAG) methods (Figure 1 left; Lewis et al. 2020; Guu et al. 2020) augment the input of LLMs\\nwith relevant retrieved passages, reducing factual errors in knowledge-intensive tasks (Ram et al.,\\n2023; Asai et al., 2023a). However, these methods may hinder the versatility of LLMs or introduce\\nunnecessary or off-topic passages that lead to low-quality generations (Shi et al., 2023) since they\\nretrieve passages indiscriminately regardless of whether the factual grounding is helpful. Moreover,\\nthe output is not guaranteed to be consistent with retrieved relevant passages (Gao et al., 2023) since\\nthe models are not explicitly trained to leverage and follow facts from provided passages. This\\nwork introduces Self-Reflective Retrieval-augmented Generation ( SELF-RAG)to improve an\\nLLM‚Äôs generation quality, including its factual accuracy without hurting its versatility, via on-demand\\nretrieval and self-reflection. We train an arbitrary LM in an end-to-end manner to learn to reflect on\\nits own generation process given a task input by generating both task output and intermittent special\\ntokens (i.e., reflection tokens ). Reflection tokens are categorized into retrieval andcritique tokens to\\nindicate the need for retrieval and its generation quality respectively (Figure 1 right). In particular,\\ngiven an input prompt and preceding generations, SELF-RAGfirst determines if augmenting the\\ncontinued generation with retrieved passages would be helpful. If so, it outputs a retrieval token that\\ncalls a retriever model on demand (Step 1). Subsequently, SELF-RAGconcurrently processes multiple\\nretrieved passages, evaluating their relevance and then generating corresponding task outputs (StepDocument 9:::\\nPrompt: Write an essay of your best summer vacation\\nPrompt: Write an essay of your best summer vacation\\nNo RetrievalMy best summer vacation is when my family and I embarked on a road trip along ‚Ä¶My best‚Ä¶ \\n>Repeat.‚Ä¶\\nNo information in passagesContradictory>Prompt +  \\nPrompt +  \\nRetrieve\\nFigure 1: Overview of SELF-RAG.SELF-RAGlearns to retrieve, critique, and generate text passages\\nto enhance overall generation quality, factuality, and verifiability.\\nconsistently retrieves a fixed number of documents for generation regardless of the retrieval necessity\\n(e.g., the bottom figure example does not require factual knowledge) and never second visits the\\ngeneration quality.

We train our generator LM on a diverse\\ncollection of text interleaved with reflection tokens and retrieved passages. Reflection tokens, inspired\\nby reward models used in reinforcement learning (Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022), are\\ninserted offline into the original corpus by a trained critic model. This eliminates the need to host a\\ncritic model during training, reducing overhead. The critic model, in part, is supervised on a dataset\\nof input, output, and corresponding reflection tokens collected by prompting a propriety LM (i.e.,\\nGPT-4; OpenAI 2023). While we draw inspiration from studies that use control tokens to start and\\nguide text generation (Lu et al., 2022; Keskar et al., 2019), our trained LM uses critique tokens to\\nassess its own predictions after each generated segment as an integral part of the generation output.\\nSELF-RAGfurther enables a customizable decoding algorithm to satisfy hard or soft constraints,\\n---\\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\\n\\nQuestion: What is the difference between RAG and self-RAG?\\n</s>\\n<|assistant|>\\nRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an ad hoc approach that augments large language models (LLMs) with the retrieval of relevant knowledge to decrease factual errors.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad\\nhoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases\\nsuch issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number\\nof retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are\\nrelevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation.\\nWe introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Gen-\\neration ( SELF-RAG)that enhances an LM‚Äôs quality and factuality through retrieval\\nand self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively\\nretrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages\\nand its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens. Generating\\nreflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it\\nto tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that SELF-\\nRAG(7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs\\nand retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, SELF-RAG\\noutperforms ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain QA,\\nreasoning and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving\\nfactuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.1\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nState-of-the-art LLMs continue to struggle with factual errors (Mallen et al., 2023; Min et al., 2023)Document 2:::\\ncalls a retriever model on demand (Step 1).

Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\n(RAG) methods (Figure 1 left; Lewis et al. 2020; Guu et al. 2020) augment the input of LLMs\\nwith relevant retrieved passages, reducing factual errors in knowledge-intensive tasks (Ram et al.,\\n2023; Asai et al., 2023a). However, these methods may hinder the versatility of LLMs or introduce\\nunnecessary or off-topic passages that lead to low-quality generations (Shi et al., 2023) since they\\nretrieve passages indiscriminately regardless of whether the factual grounding is helpful. Moreover,\\nthe output is not guaranteed to be consistent with retrieved relevant passages (Gao et al., 2023) since\\nthe models are not explicitly trained to leverage and follow facts from provided passages. This\\nwork introduces Self-Reflective Retrieval-augmented Generation ( SELF-RAG)to improve an\\nLLM‚Äôs generation quality, including its factual accuracy without hurting its versatility, via on-demand\\nretrieval and self-reflection. We train an arbitrary LM in an end-to-end manner to learn to reflect on\\nits own generation process given a task input by generating both task output and intermittent special\\ntokens (i.e., reflection tokens ). Reflection tokens are categorized into retrieval andcritique tokens to\\nindicate the need for retrieval and its generation quality respectively (Figure 1 right). In particular,\\ngiven an input prompt and preceding generations, SELF-RAGfirst determines if augmenting the\\ncontinued generation with retrieved passages would be helpful. If so, it outputs a retrieval token that\\ncalls a retriever model on demand (Step 1).

We train our generator LM on a diverse\\ncollection of text interleaved with reflection tokens and retrieved passages. Reflection tokens, inspired\\nby reward models used in reinforcement learning (Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022), are\\ninserted offline into the original corpus by a trained critic model. This eliminates the need to host a\\ncritic model during training, reducing overhead. The critic model, in part, is supervised on a dataset\\nof input, output, and corresponding reflection tokens collected by prompting a propriety LM (i.e.,\\nGPT-4; OpenAI 2023). While we draw inspiration from studies that use control tokens to start and\\nguide text generation (Lu et al., 2022; Keskar et al., 2019), our trained LM uses critique tokens to\\nassess its own predictions after each generated segment as an integral part of the generation output.\\nSELF-RAGfurther enables a customizable decoding algorithm to satisfy hard or soft constraints,\\n---\\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\\n\\nQuestion: What is the difference between RAG and self-RAG?\\n</s>\\n<|assistant|>\\nRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an ad hoc approach that augments large language models (LLMs) with the retrieval of relevant knowledge to decrease factual errors in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, RAG indiscriminately retrieves and incorporates a fixed number of retrieved passages without ensuring complete support from cited sources, which can hinder LLM versatility or lead to unhelpful response generation. In contrast, Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SELF-RAG) enhances an LLM's quality and factuality through retrieval and self-reflection. SELF-RAG trains a single arbitrary LLM to adaptively retrieve passages on demand, generate and reflect on retrieved passages and its own generations using special tokens called reflection tokens. SELF-RAG concurrently processes multiple retrieved passages, evaluates their relevance, and generates corresponding task outputs while generating critique tokens to criticize its own output and choose the best one in terms of factuality and overall quality. SELF-RAG also provides citations for each segment with its self-assessment of whether the output is supported by the passage, leading to easier fact verification. In summary, while RAG retrieves passages indiscriminately, SELF-RAG learns to retrieve, critique, and generate text passages to enhance overall generation quality, factuality, and verifiability.\""
