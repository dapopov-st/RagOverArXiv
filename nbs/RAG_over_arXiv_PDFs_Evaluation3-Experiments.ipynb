This result indicates S ELF-RAGgains are not solely from\\ntraining data and demonstrate the effectiveness of S ELF-RAGframework.\\n5.2 A NALYSIS\\nAblation studies. We conduct a set of ablations of our framework to identify which factors play\\nkey roles. We evaluate two model variants trained differently than our model: No Retriever trains an\\nLM using the standard instruction-following method given instruction-output pairs, without retrieved\\npassages; No Critic trains an LM trained with input-output pairs that are always augmented with the\\ntop one retrieved document without reflection tokens. This is similar to SAIL (Luo et al., 2023), and\\nwe use our instruction-output data instead of using the Alpaca dataset (Dubois et al., 2023), as in\\nSAIL. We also conduct ablation on our inference-time algorithm, including No retrieval disables\\nretrieval during inference; Hard constraints indicates the model performance that retrieves when\\nRetrieve =Yes instead of using the adaptive threshold; Retrieve top 1 always retrieves and uses the\\ntop one document only, similar to standard RAG approaches; Remove ISSUPindicates the model\\nperformance that removes ISSUPscore only during critique-guided beam search in Eq. 4. In this\\nablation experiment, we use a training instance size of 50k for a more efficient exploration of trainingDocument 1:::\\noutput is supported by the cited evidence). Human annotators find SELF-RAGanswers are often\\nplausible and supported by relevant passages with higher S&P scores on short-form PopQA, which is\\nconsistent with Menick et al. (2022). Human annotators also find ISRELand ISSUPreflection token\\npredictions are mostly aligned with their assessments. Appendix Table 6 shows several annotated\\nexamples and explanations on assessments.\\n6 C ONCLUSION\\nThis work introduces SELF-RAG, a new framework to enhance the quality and factuality of LLMs\\nthrough retrieval on demand and self-reflection. SELF-RAGtrains an LM to learn to retrieve, generate,\\nand critique text passages and its own generation by predicting the next tokens from its original\\nvocabulary as well as newly added special tokens, called reflection tokens. SELF-RAGfurther enables\\nthe tailoring of LM behaviors at test time by leveraging reflection tokens. Our holistic evaluations on\\nsix tasks using multiple metrics demonstrate that SELF-RAGsignificantly outperforms LLMs with\\nmore parameters or with conventional retrieval-augmented generation approaches.\\n10Preprint.\\nETHICAL CONCERNS\\nThis work aims to improve the factuality of LLM outputs, the lack of which continues to cause nu-\\nmerous real-world problems (e.g., spread of misinformation and provision of incorrect and dangerous\\nadvice). While our method shows significant improvements in terms of performance, factuality, and\\ncitation accuracy, it can still generate outputs that are not fully supported by the citations. We hope\\nthat explicit self-reflection and fine-grained attribution may help users verify factual errors in the\\nmodel outputs.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe thank Sewon Min, Scott Wen-tau Yih, Sean Welleck, and Kawin Ethayarajh for fruitful discussions\\nin the early stages of this work.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad\\nhoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases\\nsuch issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number\\nof retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are\\nrelevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation.\\nWe introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Gen-\\neration ( SELF-RAG)that enhances an LM‚Äôs quality and factuality through retrieval\\nand self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively\\nretrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages\\nand its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens. Generating\\nreflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it\\nto tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that SELF-\\nRAG(7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs\\nand retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, SELF-RAG\\noutperforms ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain QA,\\nreasoning and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving\\nfactuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.1\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nState-of-the-art LLMs continue to struggle with factual errors (Mallen et al., 2023; Min et al., 2023)Document 6:::\\nEffects of training data size. We conduct an analysis of how the data scale affects the model‚Äôs\\nperformance. In particular, we randomly sample 5k, 10k, 20k, and 50k instances from our original\\n150k training instances, and fine-tune four SELF-RAG 7Bvariants on those subsets. Then, we compare\\nthe model performance on PopQA, PubHealth, and ASQA (citation precision) with our final SELF-\\nRAGtrained on the full 150k instances. We also evaluate Figures 4a, 4b and 4c shows the models‚Äô\\nperformance trained on different amount of data. Across all datasets, increasing data size often shows\\nupward trajectories and the improvements are significantly larger in PopQA and ASQA, while we do\\nnot observed such significant improvements on Llama2-FT 7Bwhen increasing the training data from\\n50k to 150k. These results also indicate that further expanding the training data of SELF-RAGmay\\nlead to further improvements, although in this work we limit our training data size to 150k.\\nHuman evaluations. We conduct small human evaluations on SELF-RAGoutputs, as well as the\\nreliability of predicted reflection tokens. In particular, we sampled 50 samples from PopQA and Bio\\nresults. Following Menick et al. (2022), human annotators evaluate S&P , which indicates whether\\nthe model output is plausible (i.e., the output is a reasonable and on-topic response to the question\\nas if it were occurring in a conversation) and supported (i.e., the provided evidence is sufficient to\\nverify the validity of the answer). For S&P, we do not consider the instances where SELF-RAG\\npredicts irrelevant orno support . We then ask our annotators whether the model-predicted\\nreflection tokens about ISRELand ISSUPmatch their inspections (e.g., whether the fully supported\\noutput is supported by the cited evidence). Human annotators find SELF-RAGanswers are often\\nplausible and supported by relevant passages with higher S&P scores on short-form PopQA, which isDocument 7:::\\nAlgorithm 1 SELF-RAGInference\\nRequire: Generator LM M, Retriever R, Large-scale passage collections {d1, . . . , d N}\\n1:Input: input prompt xand preceding generation y<t,Output: next output segment yt\\n2:Mpredicts Retrieve given (x, y<t)\\n3:ifRetrieve ==Yes then\\n4: Retrieve relevant text passages DusingRgiven (x, yt‚àí1) ‚ñ∑Retrieve\\n5: Mpredicts ISRELgiven x, dandytgiven x, d, y <tfor each d‚ààD ‚ñ∑Generate\\n6: Mpredicts ISSUPand ISUSEgiven x, yt, dfor each d‚ààD ‚ñ∑Critique\\n7: Rank ytbased on ISREL,ISSUP,ISUSE ‚ñ∑Detailed in Section 3.3\\n8:else if Retrieve ==Nothen\\n9: Mgenpredicts ytgiven x ‚ñ∑ Generate\\n10: Mgenpredicts ISUSEgiven x, yt ‚ñ∑Critique\\nInference overview.

If retrieval is not required, the model predicts the next output segment, as it does in a\\nstandard LM. If retrieval is needed, the model generates: a critique token to evaluate the retrieved\\npassage‚Äôs relevance, the next response segment, and a critique token to evaluate if the information in\\nthe response segment is supported by the passage. Finally, a new critique token evaluates the overall\\nutility of the response.4To generate each segment, SELF-RAGprocesses multiple passages in parallel\\nand uses its own generated reflection tokens to enforce soft constraints (Section 3.3) or hard control\\n(Algorithm 1) over the generated task output. For instance, in Figure 1 (right), the retrieved passages\\nd1is selected at the first time step since d2does not provide direct evidence ( ISRELis Irrelevant)\\nandd3output is only partially supported while d1are fully supported.\\nTraining overview.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation\\n(RAG) methods (Figure 1 left; Lewis et al. 2020; Guu et al. 2020) augment the input of LLMs\\nwith relevant retrieved passages, reducing factual errors in knowledge-intensive tasks (Ram et al.,\\n2023; Asai et al., 2023a). However, these methods may hinder the versatility of LLMs or introduce\\nunnecessary or off-topic passages that lead to low-quality generations (Shi et al., 2023) since they\\nretrieve passages indiscriminately regardless of whether the factual grounding is helpful. Moreover,\\nthe output is not guaranteed to be consistent with retrieved relevant passages (Gao et al., 2023) since\\nthe models are not explicitly trained to leverage and follow facts from provided passages. This\\nwork introduces Self-Reflective Retrieval-augmented Generation ( SELF-RAG)to improve an\\nLLM‚Äôs generation quality, including its factual accuracy without hurting its versatility, via on-demand\\nretrieval and self-reflection. We train an arbitrary LM in an end-to-end manner to learn to reflect on\\nits own generation process given a task input by generating both task output and intermittent special\\ntokens (i.e., reflection tokens ). Reflection tokens are categorized into retrieval andcritique tokens to\\nindicate the need for retrieval and its generation quality respectively (Figure 1 right). In particular,\\ngiven an input prompt and preceding generations, SELF-RAGfirst determines if augmenting the\\ncontinued generation with retrieved passages would be helpful. If so, it outputs a retrieval token that\\ncalls a retriever model on demand (Step 1). Subsequently, SELF-RAGconcurrently processes multiple\\nretrieved passages, evaluating their relevance and then generating corresponding task outputs (StepDocument 9:::\\nPrompt: Write an essay of your best summer vacation\\nPrompt: Write an essay of your best summer vacation\\nNo RetrievalMy best summer vacation is when my family and I embarked on a road trip along ‚Ä¶My best‚Ä¶ \\n>Repeat.‚Ä¶\\nNo information in passagesContradictory>Prompt +  \\nPrompt +  \\nRetrieve\\nFigure 1: Overview of SELF-RAG.SELF-RAGlearns to retrieve, critique, and generate text passages\\nto enhance overall generation quality, factuality, and verifiability.\\nconsistently retrieves a fixed number of documents for generation regardless of the retrieval necessity\\n(e.g., the bottom figure example does not require factual knowledge) and never second visits the\\ngeneration quality.

We train our generator LM on a diverse\\ncollection of text interleaved with reflection tokens and retrieved passages. Reflection tokens, inspired\\nby reward models used in reinforcement learning (Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022), are\\ninserted offline into the original corpus by a trained critic model. This eliminates the need to host a\\ncritic model during training, reducing overhead. The critic model, in part, is supervised on a dataset\\nof input, output, and corresponding reflection tokens collected by prompting a propriety LM (i.e.,\\nGPT-4; OpenAI 2023). While we draw inspiration from studies that use control tokens to start and\\nguide text generation (Lu et al., 2022; Keskar et al., 2019), our trained LM uses critique tokens to\\nassess its own predictions after each generated segment as an integral part of the generation output.\\nSELF-RAGfurther enables a customizable decoding algorithm to satisfy hard or soft constraints,\\n---\\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\\n\\nQuestion: What is the difference between RAG and self-RAG?\\n</s>\\n<|assistant|>\\nRAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an ad hoc approach that augments large language models (LLMs) with the retrieval of relevant knowledge to decrease factual errors.
