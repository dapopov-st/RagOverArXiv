Building on the architecture and tok-\\nenizer of Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), TinyLlama leverages various advances\\ncontributed by the open-source community (e.g., FlashAttention (Dao, 2023)),\\nachieving better computational efficiency. Despite its relatively small size, TinyL-\\nlama demonstrates remarkable performance in a series of downstream tasks. It\\nsignificantly outperforms existing open-source language models with compara-\\nble sizes. Our model checkpoints and code are publicly available on GitHub at\\nhttps://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama .\\n1 Introduction\\nRecent progress in natural language processing (NLP) has been largely propelled by scaling up\\nlanguage model sizes (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a,b). Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) pre-trained on extensive text corpora have demonstrated their effectiveness\\non a wide range of tasks (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023b). Some empirical studies demonstrated\\nemergent abilities in LLMs, abilities that may only manifest in models with a sufficiently large number\\nof parameters, such as few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020) and chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei\\net al., 2022). Other studies focus on modeling the scaling behavior of LLMs (Kaplan et al., 2020;\\nHoffmann et al., 2022). Hoffmann et al. (2022) suggest that, to train a compute-optimal model, the\\nsize of the model and the amount of training data should be increased at the same rate. This provides\\na guideline on how to optimally select the model size and allocate the amount of training data when\\nthe compute budget is fixed.', metadata={'source': '2401.02385v1.pdf'})"

Specifically, we find that ASK-LLM sampling can train better models even after removing up to 90% of training samples, while also consistently beating well-established data curation routines. The size of the model also affects the sampling cost, which in turn impacts the quality and coverage of the pre-trained model. Our analysis shows that ASK-LLM sampling can outperform most baselines with a tiny proxy model of only 60M parameters.   \n",

The associative “System 1” of LMs can be beneficially augmented by a “System 2”\\nbased on searching a tree of possible paths to the solution to a problem. The Tree of Thoughts\\nframework provides a way to translate classical insights about problem-solving into actionable\\nmethods for contemporary LMs. At the same time, LMs address a weakness of these classical\\nmethods, providing a way to solve complex problems that are not easily formalized, such as creative\\nwriting. We see this intersection of LMs with classical approaches to AI as an exciting direction.\\n9Broader Impact\\nToT is a framework that empowers LMs to more autonomously and intelligently make decisions\\nand solve problems. While current tasks are limited to reasoning and search problems, future\\napplications involving interaction with external environments or humans could bring potential danger,\\ne.g. facilitating harmful uses of LMs. On the other hand, ToT also improves the interpretability\\nof model decisions and the opportunity for human alignment, as the resulting representations are\\nreadable, high-level language reasoning instead of implicit, low-level token values.\\nAcknowledgements\\nSY and KN acknowledge support from an Oracle Collaborative Research award and the National\\nScience Foundation under Grant No. 2239363.

The first system, \"System 1,\" is a type of LM that uses associative learning to predict the next word in a sequence based on the previous words. The second system, \"System 2,\" involves searching a tree of possible paths to the solution to a problem.

Specifically, we find that ASK-LLM sampling can train better models even after removing up to 90% of training samples, while also consistently beating well-established data curation routines. The size of the model also affects the sampling cost, which in turn impacts the quality and coverage of the pre-trained model. Our analysis shows that ASK-LLM sampling can outperform most baselines with a tiny proxy model of only 60M parameters.   \n",

Specifically, we find that ASK-LLM sampling can train better models even after removing up to 90% of training samples, while also consistently beating well-established data curation routines. The size of the model also affects the sampling cost, which in turn impacts the quality and coverage of the pre-trained model. Our analysis shows that ASK-LLM sampling can outperform most baselines with a tiny proxy model of only 60M parameters.   \n",

Moreover, SELF-RAGprovides citations for each segment with its self-assessment\\nof whether the output is supported by the passage, leading to easier fact verification.\\nSELF-RAGtrains an arbitrary LM to generate text with reflection tokens by unifying them as the\\nnext token prediction from the expanded model vocabulary. We train our generator LM on a diverse\\ncollection of text interleaved with reflection tokens and retrieved passages. Reflection tokens, inspired\\nby reward models used in reinforcement learning (Ziegler et al., 2019; Ouyang et al., 2022), are\\ninserted offline into the original corpus by a trained critic model. This eliminates the need to host a\\ncritic model during training, reducing overhead. The critic model, in part, is supervised on a dataset\\nof input, output, and corresponding reflection tokens collected by prompting a propriety LM (i.e.,\\nGPT-4; OpenAI 2023). While we draw inspiration from studies that use control tokens to start and\\nguide text generation (Lu et al., 2022; Keskar et al., 2019), our trained LM uses critique tokens to\\nassess its own predictions after each generated segment as an integral part of the generation output.\\nSELF-RAGfurther enables a customizable decoding algorithm to satisfy hard or soft constraints,Document 1:::\\nRetrieval Threshold0.60.81.0AccuracyPopQA0.00.51.0\\nFrequency\\n0.250.500.751.00\\nFrequency\\n (c) Retrieval\\nFigure 3: Analysis on SELF-RAG:(a)Ablation studies for key components of SELF-RAGtraining\\nand inference based on our 7B model.

We conduct a set of ablations of our framework to identify which factors play\\nkey roles. We evaluate two model variants trained differently than our model: No Retriever trains an\\nLM using the standard instruction-following method given instruction-output pairs, without retrieved\\npassages; No Critic trains an LM trained with input-output pairs that are always augmented with the\\ntop one retrieved document without reflection tokens. This is similar to SAIL (Luo et al., 2023), and\\nwe use our instruction-output data instead of using the Alpaca dataset (Dubois et al., 2023), as in\\nSAIL. We also conduct ablation on our inference-time algorithm, including No retrieval disables\\nretrieval during inference; Hard constraints indicates the model performance that retrieves when\\nRetrieve =Yes instead of using the adaptive threshold; Retrieve top 1 always retrieves and uses the\\ntop one document only, similar to standard RAG approaches; Remove ISSUPindicates the model\\nperformance that removes ISSUPscore only during critique-guided beam search in Eq. 4. In this\\nablation experiment, we use a training instance size of 50k for a more efficient exploration of trainingDocument 2:::\\noutput is supported by the cited evidence). Human annotators find SELF-RAGanswers are often\\nplausible and supported by relevant passages with higher S&P scores on short-form PopQA, which is\\nconsistent with Menick et al. (2022). Human annotators also find ISRELand ISSUPreflection token\\npredictions are mostly aligned with their assessments. Appendix Table 6 shows several annotated\\nexamples and explanations on assessments.\\n6 C ONCLUSION\\nThis work introduces SELF-RAG, a new framework to enhance the quality and factuality of LLMs\\nthrough retrieval on demand and self-reflection.

While our method shows significant improvements in terms of performance, factuality, and\\ncitation accuracy, it can still generate outputs that are not fully supported by the citations. We hope\\nthat explicit self-reflection and fine-grained attribution may help users verify factual errors in the\\nmodel outputs.\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nWe thank Sewon Min, Scott Wen-tau Yih, Sean Welleck, and Kawin Ethayarajh for fruitful discussions\\nin the early stages of this work.

Our end-to-end training\\nlets an LM Mgenerate text informed by retrieved passages, if needed, and criticize the output by\\nlearning to generate special tokens. These reflection tokens (Table 1) signal the need for retrieval\\nor confirm the output’s relevance, support, or completeness.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), an ad\\nhoc approach that augments LMs with retrieval of relevant knowledge, decreases\\nsuch issues. However, indiscriminately retrieving and incorporating a fixed number\\nof retrieved passages, regardless of whether retrieval is necessary, or passages are\\nrelevant, diminishes LM versatility or can lead to unhelpful response generation.\\nWe introduce a new framework called Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Gen-\\neration ( SELF-RAG)that enhances an LM’s quality and factuality through retrieval\\nand self-reflection. Our framework trains a single arbitrary LM that adaptively\\nretrieves passages on-demand, and generates and reflects on retrieved passages\\nand its own generations using special tokens, called reflection tokens. Generating\\nreflection tokens makes the LM controllable during the inference phase, enabling it\\nto tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements. Experiments show that SELF-\\nRAG(7B and 13B parameters) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs\\nand retrieval-augmented models on a diverse set of tasks. Specifically, SELF-RAG\\noutperforms ChatGPT and retrieval-augmented Llama2-chat on Open-domain QA,\\nreasoning and fact verification tasks, and it shows significant gains in improving\\nfactuality and citation accuracy for long-form generations relative to these models.1\\n1 I NTRODUCTION\\nState-of-the-art LLMs continue to struggle with factual errors (Mallen et al., 2023; Min et al., 2023)Document 6:::\\nassess its own predictions after each generated segment as an integral part of the generation output.\\nSELF-RAGfurther enables a customizable decoding algorithm to satisfy hard or soft constraints,\\nwhich are defined by reflection token predictions. In particular, our inference-time algorithm enables\\nus to (1) flexibly adjust retrieval frequency for different downstream applications and (2) customize\\nmodels’ behaviors to user preferences by leveraging reflection tokens through segment-level beam\\nsearch using the weighted linear sum of the reflection token probabilities as segment score.\\nEmpirical results on six tasks, including reasoning and long-form generation, demonstrate that SELF-\\nRAGsignificantly outperforms pre-trained and instruction-tuned LLMs that have more parameters and\\nwidely adopted RAG approaches with higher citation accuracy. In particular, SELF-RAGoutperforms\\nretrieval-augmented ChatGPT on four tasks, Llama2-chat (Touvron et al., 2023) and Alpaca (Dubois\\net al., 2023) on all tasks. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of training and inference with\\nreflection tokens for overall performance improvements as well as test-time model customizations\\n(e.g., balancing the trade-off between citation previsions and completeness).\\n2 R ELATED WORK\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments the input\\nspace of LMs with retrieved text passages (Guu et al., 2020; Lewis et al., 2020), leading to large\\nimprovements in knowledge-intensive tasks after fine-tuning or used with off-the-shelf LMs (Ram\\net al., 2023). A more recent work (Luo et al., 2023) instruction-tunes an LM with a fixed number\\n2Preprint.\\nof retrieved passages prepended to input, or pre-train a retriever and LM jointly, followed by few-\\nshot fine-tuning on task datasets (Izacard et al., 2022b). While prior work often retrieves only\\nonce at the beginning, Jiang et al. (2023) propose to adaptively retrieve passages for generationDocument 7:::\\niteratively prompts Llama2 65Bto refine output.\\nComparison against baselines with retrieval. As shown in Tables 2 (bottom), our SELF-RAGalso\\noutperforms existing RAG in many tasks, obtaining the best performance among non-proprietary\\nLM-based models on all tasks. While our method outperforms other baselines, on PopQA or Bio,\\npowerful instruction-tuned LMs with retrieval (e.g., LLama2-chat, Alpaca) show large gains from\\ntheir non-retrieval baselines. However, we found that these baselines provide limited solutions for\\ntasks where we cannot simply copy or extract sub-strings of retrieved passages. On PubHealth\\nand ARC-Challenge, baselines with retrieval do not improve performance notably from their no-\\nretrieval counterparts. We also observe that most baselines with retrieval struggle to improve citation\\naccuracy. On ASQA, our model shows significantly higher citation precision and recall than all\\nmodels except ChatGPT. Gao et al. (2023) found that ChatGPT consistently exhibits superior efficacy\\nin this particular task, surpassing smaller LMs. Our SELF-RAGbridges this performance gap, even\\noutperforming ChatGPT in citation precision, which measures whether the model-generated claim is\\nfully supported by cited evidence. We also found that on the metrics for factual precision, SELF-RAG\\n7B occasionally outperforms our 13B due to the tendency of smaller SELF-RAGto often generate\\n8Preprint.\\nPQA Med AS\\n(acc) (acc) (em)\\nSELF-RAG(50k) 45.5 73.5 32.1\\nTraining\\nNo Retriever R 43.6 67.8 31.0\\nNo Critic C 42.6 72.0 18.1\\nTest\\nNo retrieval 24.7 73.0 –\\nHard constraints 28.3 72.6 –\\nRetrieve top1 41.8 73.1 28.6\\nRemove ISSUP 44.1 73.2 30.6\\n(a) Ablation\\n1 270.070.5Precision\\n1 2\\nWeight for IsSupport9095Mauve\\n (b) Customization\\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.60.980.990.991.00Accuracy\\nPubHealth\\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6\\nRetrieval Threshold0.60.81.0AccuracyPopQA0.00.51.0\\nFrequency\\n0.250.500.751.00\\nFrequency\\n (c) Retrieval\\nFigure 3: Analysis on SELF-RAG:(a)Ablation studies for key components of SELF-RAGtrainingDocument 8:::\\nshot fine-tuning on task datasets (Izacard et al., 2022b).

(2023) train an LM to generate API calls for named\\nentities. Yet, the improved task performance of such approaches often comes at the expense of\\nruntime efficiency (Mallen et al., 2023), robustness to irrelevant context (Shi et al., 2023), and lack of\\nattributions (Liu et al., 2023a; Gao et al., 2023). We introduce a method to train an arbitrary LM to\\nlearn to use retrieval on-demand for diverse instruction-following queries and introduce controlled\\ngeneration guided by reflections tokens to further improve generation quality and attributions.\\nConcurrent RAG work. A few concurrent works2on RAG propose new training or prompting\\nstrategies to improve widely-adopted RAG approaches. Lin et al. (2023) fine-tune both the retriever\\nand LM on instruction-tuning datasets in two steps. While we also train our model on diverse\\ninstruction-following datasets, SELF-RAGenables retrieval on demand and selection of the best\\npossible model output via fine-grained self-reflection, making it widely applicable and more robust\\nand controllable. Yoran et al. (2023) use a natural language inference model and Xu et al. (2023) use\\na summarization model to filter out or compress retrieved passages before using them to prompt the\\nLM to generate the output. SELF-RAGprocesses passages in parallel and filters out irrelevant ones\\nthrough self-reflection, without relying on external models at inference. Moreover, our self-reflection\\nmechanism also evaluates other aspects of the model output quality including factuality. LATS (Zhou\\net al., 2023) prompt off-the-shelf LMs to search for relevant information for question answering tasks\\nand to generate with tree search, guided by LM-generated value scores. While their value functionDocument 9:::\\n(oryT),Cpredicts the overall utility token ISUSE, and an augmented output with reflection tokens\\nand the original input pair is added to Dgen.

During\\ntraining, we mask out the retrieved text chunks (surrounded by <p> and</p> in Figure 2) for loss\\ncalculation and expand the original vocabulary Vwith a set of reflection tokens {Critique ,Retrieve}.\\nConnections to prior work on learning with critique. Recent work incorporates additional\\ncritique (feedback) during training, e.g., RLHF (Ouyang et al. 2022) via PPO. While PPO relies on\\n5Preprint.\\nseparate reward models during training, we compute critique offline and directly insert them into the\\ntraining corpus, where the generator LM is trained with a standard LM objective. This significantly\\nreduces training costs compared to PPO. Our work also relates to prior work that incorporates special\\ntokens to control generation (Keskar et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2022; Korbak et al., 2023). Our SELF-RAG\\nlearns to generate special tokens to evaluate its own prediction after each generated segment, enabling\\nthe use of a soft re-ranking mechanism or hard constraints at inference (discussed next).\\n3.3 S ELF-RAGINFERENCE\\nGenerating reflection tokens to self-evaluate its own output makes SELF-RAGcontrollable during the\\ninference phase, enabling it to tailor its behavior to diverse task requirements.

It explains that the critic model predicts reflection tokens for evaluating retrieved passages and the quality of the task output and then uses these tokens to evaluate the relevance, support, and utility of the retrieved passages and the overall output. The response also mentions that the critic model predicts the overall utility token ISUSE and that it learns to generate reflection tokens by itself without relying on the critic at inference time.

            "In-context learning involves conditioning a language model on given context to adapt to new tasks and domains without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. This enables the model to perform well on zero-shot or few-shot learning tasks, where only a limited number of examples are available. Fusion-in-Context Learning, proposed in this paper, is a novel approach that allows a retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language model to utilize more in-context examples without modifying the model configuration or requiring additional training. This technique enables the model to learn from more examples during inference, improving its few-shot performance without sacrificing its zero-shot performance. In summary, in-context learning uses the given context to adapt the model to new tasks, while Fusion-in-Context Learning enables the model to learn from more examples during inference, improving its few-shot performance.\n",

Conclusion\\nWe proposed a class of functions called human-aware losses\\n(HALOs) based on the idea of a Kahneman-Tversky value\\nfunction, which models some of the key cognitive biases', 'tionand a weighting function :2\\nDefinition 3.1. Avalue function v:z→Rmaps an out-\\ncome z, relative to some reference point zref, to its perceived\\n(or subjective) value. For example, these functions capture\\nthe fact that humans tend to be more sensitive to relative\\nlosses than relative gains of the same magnitude.\\nDefinition 3.2.

These functions capture,\\nfor example, the fact that humans tend to overestimate the\\nchance of rare events. Let wzdenote the weight placed on\\noutcome z.\\nDefinition 3.3. The utility of a random variable Zis a\\nfunction of its outcomes: u(Z)≜P\\nz∈Zwzv(z−zref).\\nHowever, because humans do not see the full probability\\ndistribution of an LLM, weighting functions are not salient\\nto this discussion; we will focus only on value functions. Us-\\ning experiments that presented real humans with monetary\\ngambles and asked for their certainty equivalent, Tversky &amp;\\nKahneman (1992) proposed the following functional form\\nfor human value:\\nv(z, z ref;λ;α) =(\\n(z−zref)αifz &gt; z ref\\n−λ(zref−z)αifz &lt; z ref(4)\\n2Cumulative prospect theory is the full name of the expanded\\ntheory we dicuss here (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992).\\nFigure 2.

Prospect theory explains why humans make deci-\\nsions about uncertain events that do not maximize expected\\nvalue. It formalizes how humans perceive random variables\\nin a biased but well-defined manner; for example, relative to\\nsome reference point, humans are more sensitive to losses\\nthan gains, a property called loss aversion . We show that\\npopular alignment methods such as PPO (Schulman et al.,\\n2017), DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), and SLiC (Zhao et al.,\\n2023) implicitly model such biases, helping explain their\\nsuccess independently of the data used. For this reason, we\\ncall them human-aware loss functions (HALOs).\\nAlthough it is impossible to say that HALOs are categori-\\ncally better than non-HALOs, we find that among existing\\nmethods, those that meet the definition of a HALO work\\nbetter than those that do not. We find that DPO perfor-\\nmance can even be matched at most scales by running an\\noffline PPO variant on dummy +1/-1 rewards, suggesting\\nthat preference data might not be needed if the inductive\\nbias in the loss function is good enough. However, despite\\nthe surprising success of this simple baseline, it significantly\\nlags behind DPO at the 30B model scale and suffers from\\nhyperparameter sensitivity, making it difficult to use.\\nTaking a more principled approach, we derive a HALO using\\nthe model of human utility that Kahneman &amp; Tversky empir-', 'KTO: Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\\nKawin Ethayarajh1Winnie Xu2Niklas Muennighoff2Dan Jurafsky1Douwe Kiela1 2\\nAbstract\\nKahneman &amp; Tversky’s prospect theory tells us\\nthat humans perceive random variables in a biased\\nbut well-defined manner (1992); for example, hu-\\nmans are famously loss-averse. We show that\\nobjectives for aligning LLMs with human feed-\\nback implicitly incorporate many of these biases—\\nthe success of these objectives (e.g., DPO) over\\ncross-entropy minimization can partly be ascribed\\nto them being human-aware loss functions (HA-\\nLOs). However, the utility functions these meth-\\nods attribute to humans still differ from those in\\nthe prospect theory literature. Using a Kahneman-\\nTversky model of human utility, we propose a\\nHALO that directly maximizes the utility of gen-\\nerations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood\\nof preferences, as current methods do. We call\\nthis approach Kahneman-Tversky Optimization\\n(KTO), and it matches or exceeds the performance\\nof preference-based methods at scales from 1B to\\n30B. Crucially, KTO does not need preferences—\\nonly a binary signal of whether an output is desir-\\nable or undesirable for a given input. This makes\\nit far easier to use in the real world, where prefer-\\nence data is scarce and expensive.\\n1. Introduction\\nAligning generative models with human feedback has been\\nsuccessfully used to make generations more helpful, factual,\\nand ethical, among other desiderata (Ouyang et al., 2022;\\nTian et al., 2023). For LLMs, alignment methods such\\nas RLHF and DPO have consistently proven to be more\\nbeneficial than doing supervised finetuning (SFT) alone.\\nHowever, human feedback is often discussed only in the\\ncontext of preferences (e.g., output A≻Bfor input x),\\ndespite preferences being a kind of data that is relatively\\nscarce and expensive to collect in the real world (Casper\\net al., 2023). This is largely because the alignment methods\\nshown to work best—RLHF (Christiano et al., 2017) and', 'proxy, done by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of\\nthe human preference data:\\nLR(rϕ) =Ex,yw,yl∼D[−logσ(rϕ(x, yw)−rϕ(x, yl))]\\nBut solely maximizing the reward might come at the ex-\\npense of desiderata such as generating grammatical text. To\\navoid this, a KL divergence penalty is introduced to restrict\\nhow far the language model can drift from πref. Where πθis\\nthe model we are optimizing, the optimal model π∗is that\\nwhich maximizes\\nEx∈D,y∈πθ[rϕ(x, y)]−βD KL(πθ(y|x)∥πref(y|x))(2)\\nwhere β &gt; 0is a hyperparameter. Since this objective is\\nnot differentiable, we need to use an RL algorithm like PPO\\n(Schulman et al., 2017).\\n2Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\\nHowever, RLHF is often slow (largely because of having\\nto sample generations) and quite unstable in practice (espe-\\ncially in a distributed setting). For this reason, recent work\\nhas focused on designing closed-form losses that maximize\\nthe margin between the preferred and dispreferred gener-\\nations, such as Sequence-Likelihood Calibration (SLiC)\\n(Zhao et al., 2023) and Direct Preference Optimization\\n(DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). The latter has become popular\\ndue to its mathematical equivalence with RLHF:\\nLDPO(πθ, πref) =\\nE\\x14\\n−logσ\\x12\\nβlogπθ(yw|x)\\nπref(yw|x)−βlogπθ(yl|x)\\nπref(yl|x)\\x13\\x15(3)\\n3. A Prospect Theoretic View of Alignment\\nKahneman &amp; Tversky’s prospect theory explains why, faced\\nwith an uncertain event, humans make decisions that do not\\nmaximize the expected value (1992). For example, because\\nhumans are loss-averse, given a gamble that returns $100\\nwith 80% probability and $0 with 20% probability, a person\\nmight accept $60 to avoid the gamble, despite their certainty\\nequivalent of$60 being less than the expected value of $80.\\n3.1. Prospect Theory\\nIn prospect theory, human utility depends on a value func-\\ntionand a weighting function :2\\nDefinition 3.1. Avalue function v:z→Rmaps an out-\\ncome z, relative to some reference point zref, to its perceived', 'theLregterm is the standard language modeling loss.\\n3.DPO : DPO, as defined in (3), is a HALO loss (Propo-\\nsition 3.5).4.PPO (offline) : The standard RLHF objective in (2) is\\ntypically optimized with PPO-Clip, which works by\\n“clipping” how far πθcan drift from the version πoldat\\nthe previous step:\\nLPPO (offline) =−Ex,y,t∼D[min( qθA(x, y&lt;t, yt),\\nclip(qθ,1−ϵ,1 +ϵ)A(x, y&lt;t, yt))]\\nwhere qθ= logπθ\\nπoldandA(x, y&lt;t, yt)is the per-token\\nadvantage (i.e., the surplus benefit from producing a\\ngiven token in a given state).\\nPPO is an online algorithm—generations are sampled\\nfrom the current model, judged by a reward model, and\\nthen used to update the current version. However, this\\nprocess is slow (due to having to sample generations),\\nso we choose to use offline data instead. Because\\nRLHF is also quite unstable in a distributed setting, we\\nnever update πoldand keep it as πref, instead clipping\\nless conservatively than we traditionally would (see\\nAppendix B for details). Baheti et al. (2023) found that\\nthese changes, along with treating the entire output\\nsequence as a single action, greatly improves stability.\\nHowever, since RLHF has historically calculated token-\\nlevel advantages, we omit the third change and only\\npreserve the first two. The PPO-Clip loss itself is left\\nunchanged and is therefore a HALO (Proposition 3.5).\\nCalling this method PPO is somewhat imprecise, be-\\ncause it is offline and takes only one step, but to avoid\\nintroducing too many new terms, we will call this PPO\\n(offline) . Instead of using learned rewards, we simplify\\neven further and use dummy +1/-1 rewards for ywand\\nylinstead. Further details on the implementation of\\nthis method can be found in Appendix B.\\nWe compare these baselines on a suite of 7 models spanning\\ntwo model families, Pythia- {1.4B, 2.8B, 6.9B, 12B }(Bi-\\nderman et al., 2023) and Llama- {7B, 13B, 30B }(Touvron\\net al., 2023). This permits us to see how LLM alignment\\nscales within a model family (Llama-2 lacks a 30B model,', 'us to directly optimize for utility instead of maximizing the\\nlog-likelihood of preferences.

Derivation\\nFrom prior work (Go et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2019; Peters\\n&amp; Schaal, 2007), we know that the policy that maximizes\\nthe KL-constrained RLHF objective in (2) is\\nπ∗(y|x) =1\\nZ(x)πref(y|x) exp\\x121\\nβr∗(x, y)\\x13\\nwhere Z(x)is a partition function. Rafailov et al. (2023)\\nrewrite this in terms of the optimal reward for an input-\\noutput pair:\\nr∗(x, y) =βlogπ∗(y|x)\\nπref(y|x)+βlogZ(x) (6)\\nThey then plug this expression into the Bradley-Terry model\\nof preferences and take the negative logarithm of that objec-\\ntive to get the DPO loss (3).\\n5Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\\nFigure 4. Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) is as good or better than DPO at all scales, both when preceded and not preceded by\\nsupervised finetuning (SFT). In fact, for the Llama models, KTO alone matches the performance of SFT+DPO and is significantly better\\nthan DPO alone. Error bars denote a 90% binomial confidence interval.\\nInstead, we plug this expression into the Kahneman-Tversky\\nmodel of human utility, with some changes to make it more\\namenable to the LLM setting:\\n1.The exponent in the Kahneman-Tversky value func-\\ntion (4) makes it difficult to optimize, so we set vKTO\\nto be the logistic function σ, which is also concave\\nin gains and convex in losses. We replace the loss-\\naversion coefficient with two hyperparameters λD, λU\\nthat weight the losses for desirable and undesirable\\noutputs respectively.\\n2.The Kahneman-Tversky value function was derived\\nbased on experiments with humans and monetary gam-\\nbles. Since LLM generations do not have a monetary\\nreward associated with them, we set rKTOto be the\\nimplicit reward under the RLHF objective (6).']</td>\n",

The value\\nfunctions are also either concave or affine (depending on\\nthe interval), unlike the standard Kahneman-Tversky value\\nfunction, which is concave in gains but convex in losses.\\nThe reference point distributions used also differs across the\\nlosses.\\n3.3. Does being a HALO matter?\\nA natural question is whether the modeling of human biases\\nin HALOs has practical benefits. This is difficult to answer,\\nsince both HALOs and non-HALOs are diverse function\\nclasses, but we attempt to do so by comparing popular non-\\nHALO and HALO baselines on the exact same data:\\n1.CSFT : Conditional SFT is a simple alignment method\\nwhere a control token is prepended to the output during\\ntraining; then, at inference, the control token corre-\\nsponding to desirable generations (e.g., &lt;|good|&gt; ) is\\nappended to the input to induce good generations (Kor-\\nbak et al., 2023). This is a non-HALO loss.\\n2.SLiC : SLiC with a regularization penalty ( λreg̸= 0) is\\na non-HALO loss:\\nLSLiC(πθ, πref) =Lcal(πθ) +λregLreg(πθ)\\nLcal=Ex,yw,yl∼D\u0014\\nmax\u0012\\n0, δ−logπθ(yw|x)\\nπθ(yl|x)\u0013\u0015\\nLreg=Ex∼D,y∼πref(x)[−logπθ(y|x)]\\nAlthough the max-margin loss Lcalis a HALO on its\\nown (Proposition 3.5), the complete loss is not, since\\ntheLregterm is the standard language modeling loss.\\n3.DPO : DPO, as defined in (3), is a HALO loss (Propo-\\nsition 3.5).4.PPO (offline) : The standard RLHF objective in (2) isDocument 1:::\\nis illustrated in Figure 2, it should be noted that it varies\\nacross individuals (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992).

We require that the value function\\nbe concave in gains but not necessarily convex in losses—\\nunlike the canonical Kahneman-Tversky value functions—\\nbecause in the original work on prospect theory, a minority\\nof individuals were found to be risk-averse in both the gain\\nand loss regime (i.e., concave in both gains and losses)\\n(Kahneman &amp; Tversky, 1979).

Us-\\ning experiments that presented real humans with monetary\\ngambles and asked for their certainty equivalent, Tversky &amp;\\nKahneman (1992) proposed the following functional form\\nfor human value:\\nv(z, z ref;λ;α) =(\\n(z−zref)αifz &gt; z ref\\n−λ(zref−z)αifz &lt; z ref(4)\\n2Cumulative prospect theory is the full name of the expanded\\ntheory we dicuss here (Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1992).\\nFigure 2.

Prospect theory explains why humans make deci-\\nsions about uncertain events that do not maximize expected\\nvalue. It formalizes how humans perceive random variables\\nin a biased but well-defined manner; for example, relative to\\nsome reference point, humans are more sensitive to losses\\nthan gains, a property called loss aversion . We show that\\npopular alignment methods such as PPO (Schulman et al.,\\n2017), DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), and SLiC (Zhao et al.,\\n2023) implicitly model such biases, helping explain their\\nsuccess independently of the data used. For this reason, we\\ncall them human-aware loss functions (HALOs).\\nAlthough it is impossible to say that HALOs are categori-\\ncally better than non-HALOs, we find that among existing\\nmethods, those that meet the definition of a HALO work\\nbetter than those that do not. We find that DPO perfor-\\nmance can even be matched at most scales by running an\\noffline PPO variant on dummy +1/-1 rewards, suggesting\\nthat preference data might not be needed if the inductive\\nbias in the loss function is good enough. However, despite\\nthe surprising success of this simple baseline, it significantly\\nlags behind DPO at the 30B model scale and suffers from\\nhyperparameter sensitivity, making it difficult to use.\\nTaking a more principled approach, we derive a HALO using\\nthe model of human utility that Kahneman &amp; Tversky empir-Document 6:::\\nKTO: Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\\nKawin Ethayarajh1Winnie Xu2Niklas Muennighoff2Dan Jurafsky1Douwe Kiela1 2\\nAbstract\\nKahneman &amp; Tversky’s prospect theory tells us\\nthat humans perceive random variables in a biased\\nbut well-defined manner (1992); for example, hu-\\nmans are famously loss-averse. We show that\\nobjectives for aligning LLMs with human feed-\\nback implicitly incorporate many of these biases—\\nthe success of these objectives (e.g., DPO) over\\ncross-entropy minimization can partly be ascribed\\nto them being human-aware loss functions (HA-\\nLOs). However, the utility functions these meth-\\nods attribute to humans still differ from those in\\nthe prospect theory literature. Using a Kahneman-\\nTversky model of human utility, we propose a\\nHALO that directly maximizes the utility of gen-\\nerations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood\\nof preferences, as current methods do. We call\\nthis approach Kahneman-Tversky Optimization\\n(KTO), and it matches or exceeds the performance\\nof preference-based methods at scales from 1B to\\n30B. Crucially, KTO does not need preferences—\\nonly a binary signal of whether an output is desir-\\nable or undesirable for a given input. This makes\\nit far easier to use in the real world, where prefer-\\nence data is scarce and expensive.\\n1. Introduction\\nAligning generative models with human feedback has been\\nsuccessfully used to make generations more helpful, factual,\\nand ethical, among other desiderata (Ouyang et al., 2022;\\nTian et al., 2023). For LLMs, alignment methods such\\nas RLHF and DPO have consistently proven to be more\\nbeneficial than doing supervised finetuning (SFT) alone.\\nHowever, human feedback is often discussed only in the\\ncontext of preferences (e.g., output A≻Bfor input x),\\ndespite preferences being a kind of data that is relatively\\nscarce and expensive to collect in the real world (Casper\\net al., 2023). This is largely because the alignment methods\\nshown to work best—RLHF (Christiano et al., 2017) andDocument 7:::\\nproxy, done by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of\\nthe human preference data:\\nLR(rϕ) =Ex,yw,yl∼D[−logσ(rϕ(x, yw)−rϕ(x, yl))]\\nBut solely maximizing the reward might come at the ex-\\npense of desiderata such as generating grammatical text. To\\navoid this, a KL divergence penalty is introduced to restrict\\nhow far the language model can drift from πref. Where πθis\\nthe model we are optimizing, the optimal model π∗is that\\nwhich maximizes\\nEx∈D,y∈πθ[rϕ(x, y)]−βD KL(πθ(y|x)∥πref(y|x))(2)\\nwhere β &gt; 0is a hyperparameter. Since this objective is\\nnot differentiable, we need to use an RL algorithm like PPO\\n(Schulman et al., 2017).\\n2Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\\nHowever, RLHF is often slow (largely because of having\\nto sample generations) and quite unstable in practice (espe-\\ncially in a distributed setting). For this reason, recent work\\nhas focused on designing closed-form losses that maximize\\nthe margin between the preferred and dispreferred gener-\\nations, such as Sequence-Likelihood Calibration (SLiC)\\n(Zhao et al., 2023) and Direct Preference Optimization\\n(DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). The latter has become popular\\ndue to its mathematical equivalence with RLHF:\\nLDPO(πθ, πref) =\\nE\u0014\\n−logσ\u0012\\nβlogπθ(yw|x)\\nπref(yw|x)−βlogπθ(yl|x)\\nπref(yl|x)\u0013\u0015(3)\\n3. A Prospect Theoretic View of Alignment\\nKahneman &amp; Tversky’s prospect theory explains why, faced\\nwith an uncertain event, humans make decisions that do not\\nmaximize the expected value (1992). For example, because\\nhumans are loss-averse, given a gamble that returns $100\\nwith 80% probability and $0 with 20% probability, a person\\nmight accept $60 to avoid the gamble, despite their certainty\\nequivalent of$60 being less than the expected value of $80.\\n3.1.

However, this\\nprocess is slow (due to having to sample generations),\\nso we choose to use offline data instead. Because\\nRLHF is also quite unstable in a distributed setting, we\\nnever update πoldand keep it as πref, instead clipping\\nless conservatively than we traditionally would (see\\nAppendix B for details). Baheti et al. (2023) found that\\nthese changes, along with treating the entire output\\nsequence as a single action, greatly improves stability.\\nHowever, since RLHF has historically calculated token-\\nlevel advantages, we omit the third change and only\\npreserve the first two. The PPO-Clip loss itself is left\\nunchanged and is therefore a HALO (Proposition 3.5).\\nCalling this method PPO is somewhat imprecise, be-\\ncause it is offline and takes only one step, but to avoid\\nintroducing too many new terms, we will call this PPO\\n(offline) . Instead of using learned rewards, we simplify\\neven further and use dummy +1/-1 rewards for ywand\\nylinstead. Further details on the implementation of\\nthis method can be found in Appendix B.\\nWe compare these baselines on a suite of 7 models spanning\\ntwo model families, Pythia- {1.4B, 2.8B, 6.9B, 12B }(Bi-\\nderman et al., 2023) and Llama- {7B, 13B, 30B }(Touvron\\net al., 2023).

Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) is as good or better than DPO at all scales, both when preceded and not preceded by\\nsupervised finetuning (SFT). In fact, for the Llama models, KTO alone matches the performance of SFT+DPO and is significantly better\\nthan DPO alone. Error bars denote a 90% binomial confidence interval.\\nInstead, we plug this expression into the Kahneman-Tversky\\nmodel of human utility, with some changes to make it more\\namenable to the LLM setting:\\n1.The exponent in the Kahneman-Tversky value func-\\ntion (4) makes it difficult to optimize, so we set vKTO\\nto be the logistic function σ, which is also concave\\nin gains and convex in losses. We replace the loss-\\naversion coefficient with two hyperparameters λD, λU\\nthat weight the losses for desirable and undesirable\\noutputs respectively.\\n2.The Kahneman-Tversky value function was derived\\nbased on experiments with humans and monetary gam-\\nbles. Since LLM generations do not have a monetary\\nreward associated with them, we set rKTOto be the\\nimplicit reward under the RLHF objective (6).\\n---\\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\\n\\nQuestion: Given that HALOs are loss functions that model human biases in Tversky &amp; Kahneman (1992), what is the definition of a human-aware loss function according to Definition 3.4 in this context?\\n\\n\\n&lt;/s&gt;\\n&lt;|assistant|&gt;\\nIn the context of this paper, a human-aware loss function (HALO) is defined as a loss function that models some of the key cognitive biases that humans exhibit in decision-making under uncertainty, as described by Tversky and Kahneman's prospect theory (1992). Specifically, a HALO is characterized by the existence of a reference point distribution, a value function that is concave in gains and possibly convex in losses, and a negative affine function that represents a loss aversion effect. The paper proposes a new HALO called KTO, which directly maximizes the utility of LLM generations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood of preferences, as current methods do. By using a binary signal of whether an output is desirable or undesirable for a given input, KTO is easier to use in the real world, where preference data is scarce and expensive to collect. The paper also compares the performance of different alignment methods, including DPO and SLiC, and finds that those that meet the definition of a HALO perform better than those that do not.</td>\n",

Examples 20-22\\ndisplay similar behavior for other niche topics.\\n3.2. D ENSITY Sampling\\nIntuition. Our intuition is that the data distribution provides\\na strong coverage signal. High-probability regions contain\\n“prototypical” examples—ones with many near-duplicates\\nand strong representation in the dataset. Low-probability\\nregions will contain outliers, noise, and unique/rare inputs.\\nIf we wish to maximize topic coverage, we should boost the\\nsignal from under-represented portions of the input domain\\nand downsample redundant, high-density information.\\nThe key difficulty for our DENSITY sampler is to accurately\\nestimate an example’s local density. Like Tirumala et al.\\n(2023) (D4), we assume access to embeddings from a pre-trained LLM. However, we depart from the traditional ap-', 'to include a variety of practical heuristics.\\nFor example, the selection-via-proxy (SVP) algorithm de-\\ntermines the importance of an input using the validation\\nloss and uncertainty scores of a pre-trained model on the\\ninput (Coleman et al., 2020; Sachdeva et al., 2021). Paul\\net al. (2021) sample according to an “EL2N score” formed\\nby ensembling the losses of 10 lightly-trained models. En-\\nsemble prediction variance has also been used as the scoringmetric (Chitta et al., 2021), as have ensemble disagreement\\nrates (Meding et al., 2021). Other scores measure whether\\nan example is likely to be forgotten (Toneva et al., 2019),\\nmemorized (Feldman &amp; Zhang, 2020), or un-learnable (Min-\\ndermann et al., 2022).\\nIn the context of pre-training LLMs, there exist a few dif-\\nferent schools-of-thought for scoring the quality of train-\\ning samples. The first (and arguably most used) camp is\\nperplexity-filtering, where we prioritize samples with low\\nperplexity and filter out highly surprising examples (Wen-\\nzek et al., 2019; Marion et al., 2023; Muennighoff et al.,\\n2023). Notably, recent advancements in cheaper to run\\nmodel-based training-run simulators for LLMs can be used\\ntoestimate the perplexity of a training sample instead of run-\\nning an LLM inference (Guu et al., 2023). Another group\\nof methods selects training data that minimizes the distance\\nbetween the distribution of selected data and a handcrafted\\nhigh-quality data source (typically wikipedia and books).\\nTypical ways are to do this in a feature space (Xie et al.,\\n2023b) or by training a contrastive-style classifer (Radford\\net al., 2019; Anil et al., 2023; Javaheripi et al., 2023). Sim-\\nilar ideas have also been explored for optimizing the data\\nmixture weights for pre-training (Xie et al., 2023a).\\nIn concurrent work, Maini et al. (2024) also consider an\\nLLM-based approach similar to our ASK-LLM sampler,\\nbut with a focus on data paraphrasing rather than selection\\nvia quality evaluation. Engstrom et al. (2024) consider a', 'cal information to the sampler not present in perplexity:\\nASK-LLM scores show no correlation with the perplex-\\nity scores. Based on this clear behavioral difference, we\\nconclude that reasoning and context are crucial ingredients.\\nWe expect prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought\\nreasoning (Wei et al., 2022) to further drive performance.\\n4.5. When are expensive quality scores justified?\\nFigures 4c and 4f suggest that coverage scores—especially\\nthose provided by DENSITY —perform well in the mid-\\ndata regime (roughly 25% to 50% sampling rate). On\\nthe other hand, expensive quality scoring—via the ASK-\\nLLM procedure—is Pareto optimal for the entire quantity-\\nquality trade-off. The higher costs of LLM-based filters\\nare most justified in two scenarios: (i) improving full-data\\nperformance, where quality filtering by removing the lowest-\\nquality data is the main way to push the upper limit of model\\nperformance; or (ii) in the low-data regime, where keeping\\nonly the highest-quality data drives the most model perfor-\\nmance compared to other sampling strategies.\\nWe also observe that random sampling is a strong baseline,\\naligning with recent observations in the literature. Guo\\net al. (2022a) found that only three methods outperformed\\nrandom sampling in a computer vision benchmark of 15\\nalgorithms. Ayed &amp; Hayou (2023a) prove the existence of\\nadversarial problem instances where score-based samplingcannot outperform random sampling. These results only\\nserve to highlight the significance of A SK-LLM’s gains.\\n4.6. Effect of quality-scoring model capacity\\nFigure 6 demonstrates a clear scaling trend for ASK-LLM ’s\\nquality-scoring model: larger scoring models are increas-\\ningly beneficial as the scale of the to-be-trained LLM in-\\ncreases. Perplexity filters do not seem to exhibit such trends.\\nThe strongly consistent scaling for ASK-LLM also suggests\\nan interesting performance-recipe: to improve downstream\\ndata-efficiency, use better quality-scoring models. Creating', 'sampling cost on downstream performance.\\nTakeaway. Our results show that while coverage sampling\\ncanrecover the performance of the full data, ASK-LLM\\n(quality filtering) can often exceed it. These experiments\\nsuggest that LLM-based quality raters are a worthwhile and\\neffective way to drive performance in pre-training.\\n2. Related Work\\nData selection is a classical problem with well-established\\nliterature on coresets, sketching, importance sampling, filter-\\ning, denoising, and a host of other algorithms with similar\\ngoals. While we cannot possibly catalog the entire sampling\\nliterature, we hope to provide an overview of the principles\\nbehind common data selection algorithms. We also describe\\nhow these algorithms have been applied to machine learning,\\nwith a focus on language model training.\\n2.1. Coverage Sampling\\nThe first class of methods maximize the coverage of the\\nsample by selecting points that are evenly distributed across\\nthe entire input domain, e.g., an ϵ-net for a Lipschitz func-\\ntion (Phillips, 2017). When training language models, cov-\\nerage sampling is motivated by the intuition that we ought\\nto show the model the full breadth of genres, topics, and\\nlanguages (Longpre et al., 2023b). Coverage sampling is\\ntypically accomplished by embedding examples into a met-\\nric space and selecting points which are mutually far from\\neach other (Lee et al., 2023).\\nCluster sampling algorithms group inputs based on embed-\\nding similarity and select representatives from each group.\\nThese algorithms are popular, scalable, interpretable, and\\nenjoy strong theoretical support – k-means sampling prov-\\nably approximates the SVM objective (Tukan et al., 2021)\\n2How to Train Data-Efficient LLMs\\nCoverageQualityAsk-LLM\\nPerplexity\\nPrototypes\\nSemDeDup\\nDensityDPPs\\nFigure 2.

ASK-LLM consistently outperforms\\ntraining on the full dataset as well as perplexity filtering\\n(and coverage-maximizing baselines), despite having accessto a scoring model of the same model capacity (XL). Similar\\nfindings hold true for training efficiency (Figure 5).

En-\\nsemble prediction variance has also been used as the scoringmetric (Chitta et al., 2021), as have ensemble disagreement\\nrates (Meding et al., 2021). Other scores measure whether\\nan example is likely to be forgotten (Toneva et al., 2019),\\nmemorized (Feldman &amp; Zhang, 2020), or un-learnable (Min-\\ndermann et al., 2022).\\nIn the context of pre-training LLMs, there exist a few dif-\\nferent schools-of-thought for scoring the quality of train-\\ning samples. The first (and arguably most used) camp is\\nperplexity-filtering, where we prioritize samples with low\\nperplexity and filter out highly surprising examples (Wen-\\nzek et al., 2019; Marion et al., 2023; Muennighoff et al.,\\n2023). Notably, recent advancements in cheaper to run\\nmodel-based training-run simulators for LLMs can be used\\ntoestimate the perplexity of a training sample instead of run-\\nning an LLM inference (Guu et al., 2023). Another group\\nof methods selects training data that minimizes the distance\\nbetween the distribution of selected data and a handcrafted\\nhigh-quality data source (typically wikipedia and books).\\nTypical ways are to do this in a feature space (Xie et al.,\\n2023b) or by training a contrastive-style classifer (Radford\\net al., 2019; Anil et al., 2023; Javaheripi et al., 2023). Sim-\\nilar ideas have also been explored for optimizing the data\\nmixture weights for pre-training (Xie et al., 2023a).\\nIn concurrent work, Maini et al. (2024) also consider an\\nLLM-based approach similar to our ASK-LLM sampler,\\nbut with a focus on data paraphrasing rather than selection\\nvia quality evaluation. Engstrom et al. (2024) consider aDocument 7:::\\ncal information to the sampler not present in perplexity:\\nASK-LLM scores show no correlation with the perplex-\\nity scores. Based on this clear behavioral difference, we\\nconclude that reasoning and context are crucial ingredients.\\nWe expect prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought\\nreasoning (Wei et al., 2022) to further drive performance.\\n4.5. When are expensive quality scores justified?\\nFigures 4c and 4f suggest that coverage scores—especially\\nthose provided by DENSITY —perform well in the mid-\\ndata regime (roughly 25% to 50% sampling rate). On\\nthe other hand, expensive quality scoring—via the ASK-\\nLLM procedure—is Pareto optimal for the entire quantity-\\nquality trade-off. The higher costs of LLM-based filters\\nare most justified in two scenarios: (i) improving full-data\\nperformance, where quality filtering by removing the lowest-\\nquality data is the main way to push the upper limit of model\\nperformance; or (ii) in the low-data regime, where keeping\\nonly the highest-quality data drives the most model perfor-\\nmance compared to other sampling strategies.\\nWe also observe that random sampling is a strong baseline,\\naligning with recent observations in the literature. Guo\\net al. (2022a) found that only three methods outperformed\\nrandom sampling in a computer vision benchmark of 15\\nalgorithms. Ayed &amp; Hayou (2023a) prove the existence of\\nadversarial problem instances where score-based samplingcannot outperform random sampling. These results only\\nserve to highlight the significance of A SK-LLM’s gains.\\n4.6. Effect of quality-scoring model capacity\\nFigure 6 demonstrates a clear scaling trend for ASK-LLM ’s\\nquality-scoring model: larger scoring models are increas-\\ningly beneficial as the scale of the to-be-trained LLM in-\\ncreases. Perplexity filters do not seem to exhibit such trends.\\nThe strongly consistent scaling for ASK-LLM also suggests\\nan interesting performance-recipe: to improve downstream\\ndata-efficiency, use better quality-scoring models. CreatingDocument 8:::\\nsampling cost on downstream performance.\\nTakeaway. Our results show that while coverage sampling\\ncanrecover the performance of the full data, ASK-LLM\\n(quality filtering) can often exceed it. These experiments\\nsuggest that LLM-based quality raters are a worthwhile and\\neffective way to drive performance in pre-training.\\n2. Related Work\\nData selection is a classical problem with well-established\\nliterature on coresets, sketching, importance sampling, filter-\\ning, denoising, and a host of other algorithms with similar\\ngoals. While we cannot possibly catalog the entire sampling\\nliterature, we hope to provide an overview of the principles\\nbehind common data selection algorithms. We also describe\\nhow these algorithms have been applied to machine learning,\\nwith a focus on language model training.\\n2.1. Coverage Sampling\\nThe first class of methods maximize the coverage of the\\nsample by selecting points that are evenly distributed across\\nthe entire input domain, e.g., an ϵ-net for a Lipschitz func-\\ntion (Phillips, 2017). When training language models, cov-\\nerage sampling is motivated by the intuition that we ought\\nto show the model the full breadth of genres, topics, and\\nlanguages (Longpre et al., 2023b). Coverage sampling is\\ntypically accomplished by embedding examples into a met-\\nric space and selecting points which are mutually far from\\neach other (Lee et al., 2023).\\nCluster sampling algorithms group inputs based on embed-\\nding similarity and select representatives from each group.\\nThese algorithms are popular, scalable, interpretable, and\\nenjoy strong theoretical support – k-means sampling prov-\\nably approximates the SVM objective (Tukan et al., 2021)\\n2How to Train Data-Efficient LLMs\\nCoverageQualityAsk-LLM\\nPerplexity\\nPrototypes\\nSemDeDup\\nDensityDPPs\\nFigure 2.

ASK-LLM consistently outperforms\\ntraining on the full dataset as well as perplexity filtering\\n(and coverage-maximizing baselines), despite having accessto a scoring model of the same model capacity (XL). Similar\\nfindings hold true for training efficiency (Figure 5).

The paper \"How to Train Data-Efficient LLMs\" finds that coverage sampling can recover the performance of the full data, but LLM-based quality filters, such as the Ask-LLM sampler, can often exceed it, especially for larger models. This is because for smaller models, coverage sampling is sufficient to reach the upper limit of model performance, but for larger models, high-quality data becomes increasingly important. The paper also notes that random sampling is a strong baseline, but LLM-based quality raters are a worthwhile and effective way to drive performance in pre-training, as demonstrated by the Ask-LLM sampler's consistent outperformance of training on the full dataset and perplexity filtering, despite having access to a scoring model of the same model capacity (XL). The paper suggests that creating better quality-scoring models can improve downstream data-efficiency, as demonstrated by the scaling trend for Ask-LLM's quality-scoring model.</td>\n",

Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) pre-trained on extensive text corpora have demonstrated their effectiveness\\non a wide range of tasks (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023b). Some empirical studies demonstrated\\nemergent abilities in LLMs, abilities that may only manifest in models with a sufficiently large number\\nof parameters, such as few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020) and chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei\\net al., 2022). Other studies focus on modeling the scaling behavior of LLMs (Kaplan et al., 2020;\\nHoffmann et al., 2022). Hoffmann et al. (2022) suggest that, to train a compute-optimal model, the\\nsize of the model and the amount of training data should be increased at the same rate. This provides\\na guideline on how to optimally select the model size and allocate the amount of training data when\\nthe compute budget is fixed.', 'We build our framework based on lit-gpt.3In adhering to Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), we employ\\nan autoregressive language modeling objective during the pretraining phase.

We assign weight decay as 0.1, and use\\na gradient clipping threshold of 1.0 to regulate the gradient value. We pretrain TinyLlama with 16\\nA100-40G GPUs in our project.\\n3 Results\\nWe evaluate TinyLlama on a wide range of commonsense reasoning and problem-solving tasks and\\ncompare it with several existing open-source language models with similar model parameters.\\nBaseline models We primarily focus on language models with a decoder-only architecture, compris-\\ning approximately 1 billion parameters.

We believe its excellent performance and compact size make it an attractive platform for\\nresearchers and practitioners in language model research.\\n2 Pretraining\\nThis section describes how we pre-trained TinyLlama. First, we introduce the details of the pre-\\ntraining corpus and the data sampling method. Next, we elaborate on the model architecture and the\\nhyperparameters used during pretraining.\\n2.1 Pre-training data\\nOur main objective is to make the pre-training process effective and reproducible. We adopt a mixture\\nof natural language data and code data to pre-train TinyLlama, sourcing natural language data from\\nSlimPajama (Soboleva et al., 2023) and code data from Starcoderdata (Li et al., 2023). We adopt\\nLlama’s tokenizer (Touvron et al., 2023a) to process the data.\\nSlimPajama This is a large open-source corpus created for training language models based on\\nRedPajama (Together Computer, 2023). The original RedPajama corpus is an open-source research\\neffort aimed at reproducing Llama’s pretraining data (Touvron et al., 2023a) containing over 1.2\\ntrillion tokens. The SlimPajama was derived by cleaning and deduplicating the original RedPajama.\\nStarcoderdata This dataset was collected to train StarCoder (Li et al., 2023), a powerful open-\\nsource large code language model. It comprises approximately 250 billion tokens across 86 program-\\nming languages. In addition to code, it also includes GitHub issues and text-code pairs that involve\\nnatural languages. To avoid data duplication, we remove the GitHub subset of the SlimPajama and\\nonly sample code data from the Starcoderdata.\\nAfter combining these two corpora, we have approximately 950 billion tokens for pre-training in total.Document 2:::\\nonly sample code data from the Starcoderdata.\\nAfter combining these two corpora, we have approximately 950 billion tokens for pre-training in total.\\nTinyLlama is trained on these tokens for approximately three epochs, as observed by Muennighoff\\net al. (2023), where training on data repeated for up to four epochs results in minimal performance\\ndegradation compared to using unique data. During training, we sample the natural language data to\\nachieve a ratio of around 7:3 between natural language data and code data.\\n2.2 Architecture\\nWe adopt a similar model architecture to Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b). We use a Transformer\\narchitecture based on Vaswani et al. (2017) with the following details:\\n2Table 1: The details of model architecture\\nHidden size Intermediate Hidden Size Context Len Heads Layers Vocab size\\n2,048 5,632 2,048 16 22 32,000\\nPositional embedding We use RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding) (Su et al., 2021) to inject\\npositional information into our model. RoPE is a widely adopted method recently used by many\\nmainstream large language models, such as PaLM (Anil et al., 2023), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023a),\\nand Qwen (Bai et al., 2023).\\nRMSNorm In pre-normalization, to attain a more stable training, we normalize the input before\\neach transformer sub-layer. In addition, we apply RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) as our\\nnormalization technique, which can improve training efficiency.\\nSwiGLU Instead of using the traditional ReLU non-linearity, we follow Llama 2 and combine\\nSwish and Gated Linear Unit together, which is referred to as SwiGLU (Shazeer, 2020), as our\\nactivation function in TinyLlama.\\nGrouped-query Attention To reduce memory bandwidth overhead and speed up inference, we use\\ngrouped-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023) in our model. We have 32 heads for query attention\\nand use 4 groups of key-value heads. With this technique, the model can share key and value\\nrepresentations across multiple heads without sacrificing much performance.Document 3:::\\nmance of Pythia-1.4B is also included in the figure for comparison.\\nProblem-solving evaluation We also evaluate TinyLlama’s problem-solving capabilities using the\\nInstructEval benchmark (Chia et al., 2023). This benchmark includes the following tasks:\\n•Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) (Hendrycks et al., 2021): This task is\\nused to measure a model’s world knowledge and problem-solving capabilities across various\\nsubjects. We evaluate the models in a 5-shot setting.\\n•BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) (Suzgun et al., 2023): This is a subset of 23 challenging tasks from\\nthe BIG-Bench benchmark (Srivastava et al., 2022) designed to measure a language model’s\\nabilities in complex instruction following. The models are evaluated in a 3-shot setting.\\n•Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs (DROP) (Dua et al., 2019): This reading comprehen-\\nsion task measures a model’s math reasoning abilities. We evaluate the models in a 3-shot\\nsetting.\\n•HumanEval (Zheng et al., 2023): This task is used to measure a model’s programming\\ncapabilities. The models are evaluated in a zero-shot setting.\\nThe evaluation results are presented in Table 3.

It\\nsignificantly outperforms existing open-source language models with compara-\\nble sizes. Our model checkpoints and code are publicly available on GitHub at\\nhttps://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama .\\n1 Introduction\\nRecent progress in natural language processing (NLP) has been largely propelled by scaling up\\nlanguage model sizes (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a,b). Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) pre-trained on extensive text corpora have demonstrated their effectiveness\\non a wide range of tasks (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023b). Some empirical studies demonstrated\\nemergent abilities in LLMs, abilities that may only manifest in models with a sufficiently large number\\nof parameters, such as few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020) and chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei\\net al., 2022). Other studies focus on modeling the scaling behavior of LLMs (Kaplan et al., 2020;\\nHoffmann et al., 2022). Hoffmann et al. (2022) suggest that, to train a compute-optimal model, the\\nsize of the model and the amount of training data should be increased at the same rate. This provides\\na guideline on how to optimally select the model size and allocate the amount of training data when\\nthe compute budget is fixed.Document 5:::\\nWe build our framework based on lit-gpt.3In adhering to Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), we employ\\nan autoregressive language modeling objective during the pretraining phase.

Additionally, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with maximum learning rate as\\n4.0×10−4and minimum learning rate as 4.0×10−5. We use 2,000 warmup steps to facilitate\\noptimized learning.4We set the batch size as 2M tokens. We assign weight decay as 0.1, and use\\na gradient clipping threshold of 1.0 to regulate the gradient value. We pretrain TinyLlama with 16\\nA100-40G GPUs in our project.\\n3 Results\\nWe evaluate TinyLlama on a wide range of commonsense reasoning and problem-solving tasks and\\ncompare it with several existing open-source language models with similar model parameters.\\nBaseline models We primarily focus on language models with a decoder-only architecture, compris-\\ning approximately 1 billion parameters. Specifically, we compare TinyLlama with OPT-1.3B (Zhang\\net al., 2022), Pythia-1.0B, and Pythia-1.4B (Biderman et al., 2023).\\nCommonsense reasoning tasks To understand the commonsense reasoning ability of TinyLlama,\\nwe consider the following tasks: Hellaswag (Zellers et al., 2019), OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al.,\\n2018), WinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021), ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge (Clark et al., 2018),\\nBoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), and PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020). We adopt the Language Model Evaluation\\nHarness framework (Gao et al., 2023) to evaluate the models. Following previous practice (Biderman\\net al., 2023), the models are evaluated in a zero-shot setting on these tasks. The results are presentedDocument 6:::\\net al., 2023), the models are evaluated in a zero-shot setting on these tasks. The results are presented\\nin Table 2.

We conduct a set of ablations of our framework to identify which factors play\\nkey roles. We evaluate two model variants trained differently than our model: No Retriever trains an\\nLM using the standard instruction-following method given instruction-output pairs, without retrieved\\npassages; No Critic trains an LM trained with input-output pairs that are always augmented with the\\ntop one retrieved document without reflection tokens. This is similar to SAIL (Luo et al., 2023), and\\nwe use our instruction-output data instead of using the Alpaca dataset (Dubois et al., 2023), as in\\nSAIL. We also conduct ablation on our inference-time algorithm, including No retrieval disables\\nretrieval during inference; Hard constraints indicates the model performance that retrieves when\\nRetrieve =Yes instead of using the adaptive threshold; Retrieve top 1 always retrieves and uses the\\ntop one document only, similar to standard RAG approaches; Remove ISSUPindicates the model\\nperformance that removes ISSUPscore only during critique-guided beam search in Eq. 4. In this\\nablation experiment, we use a training instance size of 50k for a more efficient exploration of training', 'factual accuracy (Min et al., 2023), we aim for the model to retrieve passages more frequently to\\nensure that the output aligns closely with the available evidence. Conversely, in more open-ended\\ntasks, like composing a personal experience essay, the emphasis shifts towards retrieving less and\\nprioritizing the overall creativity or utility score. In this section, we describe approaches to enforce\\ncontrol to meet these distinct objectives during the inference process.\\nAdaptive retrieval with threshold.

However, there are also some limitations\\nsuch as unstable performance in low-shot settings,\\nand the fact that providing more in-context examples\\ndoes not consistently improve performance.\\nTo learn a better retriever and enhance the bidirec-\\ntional understanding ability of the reader, as demon-\\nstrated in Izacard et al. (2023), a practical choice is to\\npretrain the model with the masked language mod-\\neling objective, where the input is a corrupted text\\nwith several masked spans placed randomly within\\nthe sequence (refer to Figure 1 (left) for an example).\\nHowever, in testing, based on our analysis in §3.1\\nand Appendix C.1, it is most effective to place the tar-\\nget question after all the in-context examples, with a\\nmasked token (i.e., &lt;extra id0&gt;) following the ques-\\ntion (Figure 1, middle)). Thus, there exists a mismatch between pretraining and inference.\\nTo solve this issue, we propose combining retrieval-augmented masked and prefix language\\nmodeling. Specifically, in the first stage, the retriever and reader are trained jointly with\\nretrieval-augmented masked language modeling. The training objective for the retriever is\\nto minimize the KL divergence KL(pREADER ∥pRETRIEVER )between the passage posterior\\ndistribution according to the reader and the passage distribution from the retriever over\\nthe top-K retrieved passages, i.e., pREADER (d) =exp(logpLM(a|d,q))\\n∑K\\ni=1exp(logpLM(a|di,q)),pRETRIEVER (d) =\\nexp(s(d,q)/T)\\n∑K\\ni=1exp(s(di,q)/T), where s(·)calculates the dot product between the query qand passage d\\nvectors, and Tis a hyperparameter. The training objective for the reader is to maximize the\\nlikelihood of the masked spans with nretrieved passages: ∑ilogp(ai|q,{dk}1,...,n,a1:i−1).\\nIn the second stage, for each sequence, we mask 10% of the tokens on average at the end of\\nthe sequence with the &lt;extra id0&gt;token.

We conduct a set of ablations of our framework to identify which factors play\\nkey roles. We evaluate two model variants trained differently than our model: No Retriever trains an\\nLM using the standard instruction-following method given instruction-output pairs, without retrieved\\npassages; No Critic trains an LM trained with input-output pairs that are always augmented with the\\ntop one retrieved document without reflection tokens. This is similar to SAIL (Luo et al., 2023), and\\nwe use our instruction-output data instead of using the Alpaca dataset (Dubois et al., 2023), as in\\nSAIL. We also conduct ablation on our inference-time algorithm, including No retrieval disables\\nretrieval during inference; Hard constraints indicates the model performance that retrieves when\\nRetrieve =Yes instead of using the adaptive threshold; Retrieve top 1 always retrieves and uses the\\ntop one document only, similar to standard RAG approaches; Remove ISSUPindicates the model\\nperformance that removes ISSUPscore only during critique-guided beam search in Eq. 4. In this\\nablation experiment, we use a training instance size of 50k for a more efficient exploration of trainingDocument 2:::\\nfactual accuracy (Min et al., 2023), we aim for the model to retrieve passages more frequently to\\nensure that the output aligns closely with the available evidence. Conversely, in more open-ended\\ntasks, like composing a personal experience essay, the emphasis shifts towards retrieving less and\\nprioritizing the overall creativity or utility score. In this section, we describe approaches to enforce\\ncontrol to meet these distinct objectives during the inference process.\\nAdaptive retrieval with threshold. SELF-RAGdynamically decides when to retrieve text passages by\\npredicting Retrieve . Alternatively, our framework allows a threshold to be set.

However, there are also some limitations\\nsuch as unstable performance in low-shot settings,\\nand the fact that providing more in-context examples\\ndoes not consistently improve performance.\\nTo learn a better retriever and enhance the bidirec-\\ntional understanding ability of the reader, as demon-\\nstrated in Izacard et al. (2023), a practical choice is to\\npretrain the model with the masked language mod-\\neling objective, where the input is a corrupted text\\nwith several masked spans placed randomly within\\nthe sequence (refer to Figure 1 (left) for an example).\\nHowever, in testing, based on our analysis in §3.1\\nand Appendix C.1, it is most effective to place the tar-\\nget question after all the in-context examples, with a\\nmasked token (i.e., &lt;extra id0&gt;) following the ques-\\ntion (Figure 1, middle)). Thus, there exists a mismatch between pretraining and inference.\\nTo solve this issue, we propose combining retrieval-augmented masked and prefix language\\nmodeling. Specifically, in the first stage, the retriever and reader are trained jointly with\\nretrieval-augmented masked language modeling. The training objective for the retriever is\\nto minimize the KL divergence KL(pREADER ∥pRETRIEVER )between the passage posterior\\ndistribution according to the reader and the passage distribution from the retriever over\\nthe top-K retrieved passages, i.e., pREADER (d) =exp(logpLM(a|d,q))\\n∑K\\ni=1exp(logpLM(a|di,q)),pRETRIEVER (d) =\\nexp(s(d,q)/T)\\n∑K\\ni=1exp(s(di,q)/T), where s(·)calculates the dot product between the query qand passage d\\nvectors, and Tis a hyperparameter. The training objective for the reader is to maximize the\\nlikelihood of the masked spans with nretrieved passages: ∑ilogp(ai|q,{dk}1,...,n,a1:i−1).\\nIn the second stage, for each sequence, we mask 10% of the tokens on average at the end of\\nthe sequence with the &lt;extra id0&gt;token.

Building upon the analysis, we develop models\\nwith enhanced zero-shot performance and improved in-context learning abilities.\\n3.1 In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder LMs\\nTo investigate the in-context learning ability of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder\\nlanguage models, we first aim to gain insights from the state-of-the-art designs in the\\nliterature. Among them, the design of ATLAS (Izacard et al., 2023) stands out; it combines\\na general-purpose dense retriever with a sequence-to-sequence reader (i.e., T5 (Raffel et al.,\\n2020)) using the Fusion-in-Decoder architecture (Izacard &amp; Grave, 2021). The retriever,\\nencoder and decoder are jointly trained during the pretraining process. In this process,\\nthe dense retriever, based on the Contriever model (Izacard et al., 2022), is responsible\\nfor selecting relevant passages from an external knowledge source, e.g., Wikipedia, based\\non the given corrupted context. The retrieved passages are then processed along with the\\ncontext by the encoder, which generates the corresponding output, i.e., the masked spans,\\nat the decoder (Figure 1, left). ATLAS demonstrates exceptional few-shot performance on\\nknowledge-intensive language tasks (Petroni et al., 2021), despite having a lower parameter\\ncount compared to other recent LLMs.\\nHowever, in Izacard et al. (2023), the few-shot performance is achieved by finetuning\\nthe model with few-shot examples, which requires additional training and may limit its\\napplications, such as dealing with dynamic and diverse real-time user queries like GPT-\\n3/4 (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023), where in-context learning plays a vital role. Therefore,\\nwe take the initiative to explore the in-context learning ability of this type of models, using', 'from an external corpus. Among these, the encoder-decoder models, such as ATLAS (Izacard\\net al., 2023), stand out. They benefit from the strong representation ability of a bidirectional\\nencoder, coupled with of the efficacy of a Fusion-in-Decoder architecture (Izacard &amp; Grave,\\n2021), enabling the effective integration of multiple retrieved passages. Despite these\\nadvancements, in-context learning with these models remains underexplored.\\nIn this regard, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art retrieval-\\naugmented encoder-decoder language models by designing and experimenting with differ-\\nent prompting strategies. We find that these models exhibit a certain in-context learning\\nability; however, due to a mismatch between pretraining and inference and a limited context\\nlength—issues that are common to existing encoder-decoder LMs trained with masked\\nlanguage modeling—its few-shot performance is not stable and providing more than, e.g.,\\n8-shot, examples does not lead to further improvement.\\nBased on the analysis, we develop RAVEN1by first mitigating the mismatch between\\npretraining and inference through a combination of retrieval-augmented masked language\\nmodeling and prefix language modeling. Moreover, to enable the model to learn from more\\nin-context examples, we propose Fusion-in-Context Learning , a novel approach that allows\\nthe model to utilize more in-context examples without modifying the model configuration\\nor requiring additional training. Furthermore, we suggest using the retriever of the model to\\nobtain relevant in-context examples to further enhance few-shot performance. Our empirical\\nresults demonstrate that RAVEN significantly outperforms previous retrieval-augmented\\nencoder-decoder LMs in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, even achieving comparable\\nresults to decoder-only LLMs in some settings despite having 180 times fewer parameters.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are twofold:', 'results to decoder-only LLMs in some settings despite having 180 times fewer parameters.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are twofold:\\n•From an analytical standpoint, we provide a thorough analysis of the in-context learning\\nability of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language models.

These techniques, though simple, are highly effective. They not\\nonly enhance the base model’s capabilities but also highlight the potential of in-context\\nlearning with retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder LMs.\\n2 Background and Related Work\\nRetrieval-augmented language models are a class of language models designed to enhance\\ntheir performance by incorporating external knowledge. These models typically employ\\nan information retrieval mechanism to access relevant information from a large corpus,\\nwhich is then integrated into the model’s prediction process. Retrieval-augmented LMs\\ncan be based on both encoder-decoder (Izacard et al., 2023; Lewis et al., 2020) and decoder-\\nonly (Khandelwal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022) architectures. For\\ndecoder-only LMs, the computational cost typically increases quadratically with the input\\nlength, as well as with the number of retrieval passages. In contrast, for encoder-decoder\\nLMs with a Fusion-in-Decoder architecture, the computation cost grows linearly with the\\nnumber of retrieved passages, as they only perform self-attention over one passage at a\\ntime (Izacard &amp; Grave, 2021). This concept is also investigated by Ye et al. (2023) for more\\nefficient in-context learning.\\nWhile there has been some research on in-context learning with retrieval-augmented\\ndecoder-only LMs, which can be straightforwardly implemented by concatenating retrieved', '6In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 8&gt;8\\n# In-Context Examples2628303234Natural Questions, EM\\nRAVEN 11B\\n + FICL\\nATLAS 11B\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 8&gt;8\\n# In-Context Examples56586062646668TriviaQA, EM\\nFigure 5: RAVEN vsATLAS . We report the best observed performance achieved with more\\nthan eight shots for “ &gt;8”.\\nBy integrating RAVEN ’s retriever in this manner, we aim to: 1) automate in-context learning,\\nwhich is particularly practical for model owners who have a database of examples. Without\\nthis, users would need to manually provide in-context examples; and 2) optimize the\\nselection of in-context examples, thereby improving in-context learning performance.\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Experimental Setup\\nDatasets. Following the setup in §3.1, we first evaluate on two widely-used open-domain\\nquestion answering datasets: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and Trivi-\\naQA (Joshi et al., 2017). Additionally, we conduct a case study on long-form question\\nanswering using the ELI5 dataset (Fan et al., 2019). Furthermore, we assess the models’\\nlanguage understanding ability using the Massively Multitask Language Understanding\\n(MMLU) benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021). Detailed information regarding the MMLU\\nevaluation is in Appendix B.5. Other evaluation settings are the same as §B.1.\\nBaselines. Since both RAVEN and ATLAS (Izacard et al., 2023) are trained starting from T5,\\nwe choose ATLAS as a primary baseline for comparison. We also compare our model with\\ndecoder-only LLMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), and\\nLLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) (in a closed-book setting). Additionally, for open-domain\\nQA, we evaluate our approach against REPLUG (Shi et al., 2023) and RETRO (Borgeaud\\net al., 2022), as well as its improved version RETRO ++(Wang et al., 2023). These models are\\ndecoder-only language models augmented with retrieval. REPLUG is based on Codex (Chen', 'Effect of Number of In-Context Examples. The number of in-context examples is a crucial\\nhyperparameter for in-context learning. Generally, we expect better performance from a\\nmodel with more in-context examples, but there is an upper limit due to 1) the maximum con-\\ntext length setup, e.g., 512 tokens, during the pretraining process, and 2) the point at which\\nthe model has received sufficient examples and cannot gain additional information from\\nmore examples. The optimal number of in-context examples also varies between models.\\nFor instance, on TriviaQA, PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2023) exhibits better 1-shot performance\\nthan settings with more examples, while this is not the case for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020).\\n3Experimental setup is detailed in the Appendix B.1.\\n4In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models\\nFigure 2 illustrates the impact of varying the number of in-context examples across different\\nmodel sizes. Interestingly, the 11B model demonstrates poor performance in low-shot\\nsettings, e.g., 1-shot, but improves significantly after 4-shot and 5-shot. Upon examining the\\ngenerated responses, we find that the model tends to produce answers with more tokens\\nin low-shot settings, while the ground truth typically consists of shorter answers with\\nfewer than 5 tokens. By relaxing the criteria for a correct prediction to include instances\\nwhere the ground-truth answer is a substring of the model output, we find that the 1-shot\\nperformance surpasses that of the 0-shot setting (38.3 vs 32.1 on NQ).\\nAll models perform well in the 5-shot and 8-shot settings, but their performance does not\\ncontinue to improve with more in-context examples (e.g., 16-shot). We believe this plateau\\nmay be attributed to two factors: 1) the sequence length constraints during pretraining,\\nwhere the maximum input length to the encoder is set to 384 tokens, and the average input']</td>\n",

This highlights the superiority of the encoder-decoder (Fusion-in-Decoder)\\narchitecture, which offers an advantage not available to decoder-only language models.\\n3.2 R AVEN : Combining Retrieval-Augmented Masked and Prefix Language Modeling\\nInputtoEncoder:Machinelearningalgorithmsbuildamodelbasedonsampledata,knownastrainingdata,inordertomakepredictionsordecisionswithoutbeingexplicitlyprogrammedtodoso.Machinelearningalgorithmsareusedinawidevarietyofapplications,suchasinmedicine,emailfiltering,speechrecognition,agriculture,andcomputervision,whereitisdifficultor&lt;extra_id_0&gt;Passage:…machinelearningmodelsrequireahighquantityofreliabledatainorderforthemodels…InputtoDecoder:NoneOutput:&lt;extra_id_0&gt;unfeasibletodevelopconventionalalgorithmstoperformtheneededtasks.   ��������������������������������������������\\nFigure 3: Retrieval-augmented prefix\\nlanguage modeling.In§3.1, we observe that retrieval-augmented\\nencoder-decoder LMs exhibit a certain ability for in-\\ncontext learning, which has been overlooked in previ-\\nous studies.

Building upon the analysis, we develop models\\nwith enhanced zero-shot performance and improved in-context learning abilities.\\n3.1 In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder LMs\\nTo investigate the in-context learning ability of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder\\nlanguage models, we first aim to gain insights from the state-of-the-art designs in the\\nliterature. Among them, the design of ATLAS (Izacard et al., 2023) stands out; it combines\\na general-purpose dense retriever with a sequence-to-sequence reader (i.e., T5 (Raffel et al.,\\n2020)) using the Fusion-in-Decoder architecture (Izacard &amp; Grave, 2021). The retriever,\\nencoder and decoder are jointly trained during the pretraining process. In this process,\\nthe dense retriever, based on the Contriever model (Izacard et al., 2022), is responsible\\nfor selecting relevant passages from an external knowledge source, e.g., Wikipedia, based\\non the given corrupted context. The retrieved passages are then processed along with the\\ncontext by the encoder, which generates the corresponding output, i.e., the masked spans,\\nat the decoder (Figure 1, left). ATLAS demonstrates exceptional few-shot performance on\\nknowledge-intensive language tasks (Petroni et al., 2021), despite having a lower parameter\\ncount compared to other recent LLMs.\\nHowever, in Izacard et al. (2023), the few-shot performance is achieved by finetuning\\nthe model with few-shot examples, which requires additional training and may limit its\\napplications, such as dealing with dynamic and diverse real-time user queries like GPT-\\n3/4 (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023), where in-context learning plays a vital role. Therefore,\\nwe take the initiative to explore the in-context learning ability of this type of models, usingDocument 6:::\\nfrom an external corpus. Among these, the encoder-decoder models, such as ATLAS (Izacard\\net al., 2023), stand out. They benefit from the strong representation ability of a bidirectional\\nencoder, coupled with of the efficacy of a Fusion-in-Decoder architecture (Izacard &amp; Grave,\\n2021), enabling the effective integration of multiple retrieved passages. Despite these\\nadvancements, in-context learning with these models remains underexplored.\\nIn this regard, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art retrieval-\\naugmented encoder-decoder language models by designing and experimenting with differ-\\nent prompting strategies. We find that these models exhibit a certain in-context learning\\nability; however, due to a mismatch between pretraining and inference and a limited context\\nlength—issues that are common to existing encoder-decoder LMs trained with masked\\nlanguage modeling—its few-shot performance is not stable and providing more than, e.g.,\\n8-shot, examples does not lead to further improvement.\\nBased on the analysis, we develop RAVEN1by first mitigating the mismatch between\\npretraining and inference through a combination of retrieval-augmented masked language\\nmodeling and prefix language modeling. Moreover, to enable the model to learn from more\\nin-context examples, we propose Fusion-in-Context Learning , a novel approach that allows\\nthe model to utilize more in-context examples without modifying the model configuration\\nor requiring additional training. Furthermore, we suggest using the retriever of the model to\\nobtain relevant in-context examples to further enhance few-shot performance. Our empirical\\nresults demonstrate that RAVEN significantly outperforms previous retrieval-augmented\\nencoder-decoder LMs in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, even achieving comparable\\nresults to decoder-only LLMs in some settings despite having 180 times fewer parameters.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are twofold:Document 7:::\\nresults to decoder-only LLMs in some settings despite having 180 times fewer parameters.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are twofold:\\n•From an analytical standpoint, we provide a thorough analysis of the in-context learning\\nability of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language models.

They not\\nonly enhance the base model’s capabilities but also highlight the potential of in-context\\nlearning with retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder LMs.\\n2 Background and Related Work\\nRetrieval-augmented language models are a class of language models designed to enhance\\ntheir performance by incorporating external knowledge. These models typically employ\\nan information retrieval mechanism to access relevant information from a large corpus,\\nwhich is then integrated into the model’s prediction process. Retrieval-augmented LMs\\ncan be based on both encoder-decoder (Izacard et al., 2023; Lewis et al., 2020) and decoder-\\nonly (Khandelwal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022) architectures. For\\ndecoder-only LMs, the computational cost typically increases quadratically with the input\\nlength, as well as with the number of retrieval passages. In contrast, for encoder-decoder\\nLMs with a Fusion-in-Decoder architecture, the computation cost grows linearly with the\\nnumber of retrieved passages, as they only perform self-attention over one passage at a\\ntime (Izacard &amp; Grave, 2021). This concept is also investigated by Ye et al. (2023) for more\\nefficient in-context learning.\\nWhile there has been some research on in-context learning with retrieval-augmented\\ndecoder-only LMs, which can be straightforwardly implemented by concatenating retrievedDocument 8:::\\n6In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 8&gt;8\\n# In-Context Examples2628303234Natural Questions, EM\\nRAVEN 11B\\n + FICL\\nATLAS 11B\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 8&gt;8\\n# In-Context Examples56586062646668TriviaQA, EM\\nFigure 5: RAVEN vsATLAS .

Without\\nthis, users would need to manually provide in-context examples; and 2) optimize the\\nselection of in-context examples, thereby improving in-context learning performance.\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Experimental Setup\\nDatasets. Following the setup in §3.1, we first evaluate on two widely-used open-domain\\nquestion answering datasets: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and Trivi-\\naQA (Joshi et al., 2017). Additionally, we conduct a case study on long-form question\\nanswering using the ELI5 dataset (Fan et al., 2019). Furthermore, we assess the models’\\nlanguage understanding ability using the Massively Multitask Language Understanding\\n(MMLU) benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021). Detailed information regarding the MMLU\\nevaluation is in Appendix B.5. Other evaluation settings are the same as §B.1.\\nBaselines. Since both RAVEN and ATLAS (Izacard et al., 2023) are trained starting from T5,\\nwe choose ATLAS as a primary baseline for comparison. We also compare our model with\\ndecoder-only LLMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), and\\nLLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) (in a closed-book setting). Additionally, for open-domain\\nQA, we evaluate our approach against REPLUG (Shi et al., 2023) and RETRO (Borgeaud\\net al., 2022), as well as its improved version RETRO ++(Wang et al., 2023). These models are\\ndecoder-only language models augmented with retrieval. REPLUG is based on Codex (ChenDocument 9:::\\nEffect of Number of In-Context Examples. The number of in-context examples is a crucial\\nhyperparameter for in-context learning. Generally, we expect better performance from a\\nmodel with more in-context examples, but there is an upper limit due to 1) the maximum con-\\ntext length setup, e.g., 512 tokens, during the pretraining process, and 2) the point at which\\nthe model has received sufficient examples and cannot gain additional information from\\nmore examples. The optimal number of in-context examples also varies between models.\\nFor instance, on TriviaQA, PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2023) exhibits better 1-shot performance\\nthan settings with more examples, while this is not the case for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020).\\n3Experimental setup is detailed in the Appendix B.1.\\n4In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models\\nFigure 2 illustrates the impact of varying the number of in-context examples across different\\nmodel sizes. Interestingly, the 11B model demonstrates poor performance in low-shot\\nsettings, e.g., 1-shot, but improves significantly after 4-shot and 5-shot. Upon examining the\\ngenerated responses, we find that the model tends to produce answers with more tokens\\nin low-shot settings, while the ground truth typically consists of shorter answers with\\nfewer than 5 tokens. By relaxing the criteria for a correct prediction to include instances\\nwhere the ground-truth answer is a substring of the model output, we find that the 1-shot\\nperformance surpasses that of the 0-shot setting (38.3 vs 32.1 on NQ).\\nAll models perform well in the 5-shot and 8-shot settings, but their performance does not\\ncontinue to improve with more in-context examples (e.g., 16-shot). We believe this plateau\\nmay be attributed to two factors: 1) the sequence length constraints during pretraining,\\nwhere the maximum input length to the encoder is set to 384 tokens, and the average input\\n---\\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\\n\\nQuestion: How effective are prompting strategies for in-context learning in encoder-decoder language models?\\n\\n\\n&lt;/s&gt;\\n&lt;|assistant|&gt;\\nIn the context of in-context learning for encoder-decoder language models, prompting strategies have been identified as a crucial factor for effective performance. Two prompting strategies have been proposed: Strategy 1 involves feeding all example question-answer pairs and the target question to the encoder, without any input to the decoder. Strategy 2 feeds the same input as Strategy 1, but also includes the target question as input to the decoder. The paper \"In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models\" by Jie Huang et al. (2023) explores the in-context learning ability of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language models and proposes a new model called RAVEN (Retrieval-Augmented VEner) to enhance zero-shot performance and improve in-context learning abilities. The paper also suggests Fusion-in-Context Learning and In-Context Example Retrieval strategies to enable the model to utilize more in-context examples without additional training or modifying the model configuration. Experimental results show that RAVEN significantly outperforms previous retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder LMs in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, despite having substantially fewer parameters. The paper highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder LMs for in-context learning and encourages further research in this direction.</td>\n",

Therefore,\\nwe take the initiative to explore the in-context learning ability of this type of models, using\\nopen-domain question answering (Chen et al., 2017) as a representative task for some\\npreliminary experiments.\\nPrompting Strategies. To facilitate in-context learning, an effective prompting strategy is\\nparamount. In contrast to decoder-only LMs, where the input can only be fed to the decoder,\\nencoder-decoder LMs can take input in either the encoder or the decoder. In alignment with\\nthe pretraining objective, we identify two prompting strategies for in-context learning:\\nStrategy 1. The first strategy involves feeding all example question-answer pairs and the\\ntarget question to the encoder, without any input to the decoder. The prompt is designed as:2\\n2Here we present a format designed for better demonstration.

Specifically, we find that ASK-LLM sampling can train better models even after removing up to 90% of training samples, while also consistently beating well-established data curation routines. The size of the model also affects the sampling cost, which in turn impacts the quality and coverage of the pre-trained model. Our analysis shows that ASK-LLM sampling can outperform most baselines with a tiny proxy model of only 60M parameters.   \n",

Does being a HALO matter?\\nA natural question is whether the modeling of human biases\\nin HALOs has practical benefits. This is difficult to answer,\\nsince both HALOs and non-HALOs are diverse function\\nclasses, but we attempt to do so by comparing popular non-\\nHALO and HALO baselines on the exact same data:\\n1.CSFT : Conditional SFT is a simple alignment method\\nwhere a control token is prepended to the output during\\ntraining; then, at inference, the control token corre-\\nsponding to desirable generations (e.g., <|good|> ) is\\nappended to the input to induce good generations (Kor-\\nbak et al., 2023). This is a non-HALO loss.\\n2.SLiC : SLiC with a regularization penalty ( λreg̸= 0) is\\na non-HALO loss:\\nLSLiC(πθ, πref) =Lcal(πθ) +λregLreg(πθ)\\nLcal=Ex,yw,yl∼D\\x14\\nmax\\x12\\n0, δ−logπθ(yw|x)\\nπθ(yl|x)\\x13\\x15\\nLreg=Ex∼D,y∼πref(x)[−logπθ(y|x)]\\nAlthough the max-margin loss Lcalis a HALO on its\\nown (Proposition 3.5), the complete loss is not, since\\ntheLregterm is the standard language modeling loss.\\n3.DPO : DPO, as defined in (3), is a HALO loss (Propo-\\nsition 3.5).4.PPO (offline) : The standard RLHF objective in (2) is', 'is illustrated in Figure 2, it should be noted that it varies\\nacross individuals (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992). There\\nare also other functional forms for the value function that\\nhave been proposed in later work (Gurevich et al., 2009).\\nThe salient qualities of a value function are: the existence\\nof a reference point that is added or subtracted to get the\\nrelative gain or loss respectively; concavity in relative gains\\n(i.e. diminishing sensitivity away from zref); loss aversion\\n(i.e., greater sensitivity to losses).\\n3.2. HALOs\\nInformally, HALOs are loss functions that model the human\\nbiases in Tversky & Kahneman (1992). Formally,\\nDefinition 3.4 (HALOs ).Letx∈ X denote an input and\\ny∈ Y an output.

The reference point is the expected re-\\nward with respect to input-output pairs sampled from the\\ndistributions Qx, Qy. We require that the value function\\nbe concave in gains but not necessarily convex in losses—\\nunlike the canonical Kahneman-Tversky value functions—\\nbecause in the original work on prospect theory, a minority\\nof individuals were found to be risk-averse in both the gain\\nand loss regime (i.e., concave in both gains and losses)\\n(Kahneman & Tversky, 1979).

Conclusion\\nWe proposed a class of functions called human-aware losses\\n(HALOs) based on the idea of a Kahneman-Tversky value\\nfunction, which models some of the key cognitive biases\\nthat inform how humans make decisions about uncertain out-\\ncomes. We showed that among existing alignment methods,\\nthose that met the definition of a HALO performed better\\nthan those that did not, suggesting a benefit to the modeling\\nof human biases. We then designed a human-aware loss\\ncalled KTO for directly maximizing the utility of genera-\\ntions instead of maximizing preference likelihood. Despite\\nonly learning from a binary signal of whether an output is\\n(un)desirable, KTO is as good or better than DPO at scales\\nfrom 1B to 30B. Still, we make no claims that KTO is the\\nbest HALO for all scenarios; there remains much work to\\nbe done in discovering the optimal human-aware for each\\nsetting.\\n9Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe thank Dilip Arumugam and Arya McCarthy for feedback\\non the paper and Nathan Lambert for feedback on an early\\nversion of this draft.

Future Work\\nThe existence of HALOs raises many questions. For one,\\nthe KTO loss is based on the Kahneman-Tversky value\\nfunction for monetary gains and losses, which is almost\\ncertainly different from how humans perceive the relative\\ngoodness of text. What value function—and corresponding\\nHALO—best describes how humans perceive language?\\nGiven that the data that KTO needs is much more abun-\\ndant, cheaper, and faster to collect—both as human and AI\\nfeedback—how far can we push synthetic data? For exam-\\nple, if we wanted to create a toxicity dataset to align our\\nmodels to be less toxic, creating a tuple (x, yw, yl)where yl\\nis more toxic than ywis non-trivial. However, with KTO, we\\ncan easily create a dataset where desirability is determined\\nby some black-box toxicity detection API. What other kinds\\nof desiderata can we synthetically optimize for with KTO?\\nCan we convert signals like “conversation lead to sale made”\\nor “support ticket resolved” into KTO data?\\nCurrently, KTO can learn from score-based data when the\\nscore is used to infer desirability.

For example, these functions capture\\nthe fact that humans tend to be more sensitive to relative\\nlosses than relative gains of the same magnitude.\\nDefinition 3.2. Aweighting function wis the derivative of\\nacapacity function that maps cumulative probabilities to\\nperceived cumulative probabilities. These functions capture,\\nfor example, the fact that humans tend to overestimate the\\nchance of rare events. Let wzdenote the weight placed on\\noutcome z.\\nDefinition 3.3. The utility of a random variable Zis a\\nfunction of its outcomes: u(Z)≜P\\nz∈Zwzv(z−zref).\\nHowever, because humans do not see the full probability\\ndistribution of an LLM, weighting functions are not salient\\nto this discussion; we will focus only on value functions. Us-\\ning experiments that presented real humans with monetary\\ngambles and asked for their certainty equivalent, Tversky &\\nKahneman (1992) proposed the following functional form\\nfor human value:\\nv(z, z ref;λ;α) =(\\n(z−zref)αifz > z ref\\n−λ(zref−z)αifz < z ref(4)\\n2Cumulative prospect theory is the full name of the expanded\\ntheory we dicuss here (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992).\\nFigure 2.

While\\nthe shape of the median Kahneman-Tversky value function\\nis illustrated in Figure 2, it should be noted that it varies\\nacross individuals (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992). There\\nare also other functional forms for the value function that', 'scarce and expensive to collect in the real world (Casper\\net al., 2023).

Prospect theory explains why humans make deci-\\nsions about uncertain events that do not maximize expected\\nvalue. It formalizes how humans perceive random variables\\nin a biased but well-defined manner; for example, relative to\\nsome reference point, humans are more sensitive to losses\\nthan gains, a property called loss aversion . We show that\\npopular alignment methods such as PPO (Schulman et al.,\\n2017), DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), and SLiC (Zhao et al.,\\n2023) implicitly model such biases, helping explain their\\nsuccess independently of the data used. For this reason, we\\ncall them human-aware loss functions (HALOs).\\nAlthough it is impossible to say that HALOs are categori-\\ncally better than non-HALOs, we find that among existing\\nmethods, those that meet the definition of a HALO work\\nbetter than those that do not. We find that DPO perfor-\\nmance can even be matched at most scales by running an\\noffline PPO variant on dummy +1/-1 rewards, suggesting\\nthat preference data might not be needed if the inductive\\nbias in the loss function is good enough. However, despite\\nthe surprising success of this simple baseline, it significantly\\nlags behind DPO at the 30B model scale and suffers from\\nhyperparameter sensitivity, making it difficult to use.\\nTaking a more principled approach, we derive a HALO using\\nthe model of human utility that Kahneman & Tversky empir-', 'KTO: Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\\nKawin Ethayarajh1Winnie Xu2Niklas Muennighoff2Dan Jurafsky1Douwe Kiela1 2\\nAbstract\\nKahneman & Tversky’s prospect theory tells us\\nthat humans perceive random variables in a biased\\nbut well-defined manner (1992); for example, hu-\\nmans are famously loss-averse. We show that\\nobjectives for aligning LLMs with human feed-\\nback implicitly incorporate many of these biases—\\nthe success of these objectives (e.g., DPO) over\\ncross-entropy minimization can partly be ascribed\\nto them being human-aware loss functions (HA-\\nLOs). However, the utility functions these meth-\\nods attribute to humans still differ from those in\\nthe prospect theory literature. Using a Kahneman-\\nTversky model of human utility, we propose a\\nHALO that directly maximizes the utility of gen-\\nerations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood\\nof preferences, as current methods do. We call\\nthis approach Kahneman-Tversky Optimization\\n(KTO), and it matches or exceeds the performance\\nof preference-based methods at scales from 1B to\\n30B. Crucially, KTO does not need preferences—\\nonly a binary signal of whether an output is desir-\\nable or undesirable for a given input. This makes\\nit far easier to use in the real world, where prefer-\\nence data is scarce and expensive.\\n1. Introduction\\nAligning generative models with human feedback has been\\nsuccessfully used to make generations more helpful, factual,\\nand ethical, among other desiderata (Ouyang et al., 2022;\\nTian et al., 2023). For LLMs, alignment methods such\\nas RLHF and DPO have consistently proven to be more\\nbeneficial than doing supervised finetuning (SFT) alone.\\nHowever, human feedback is often discussed only in the\\ncontext of preferences (e.g., output A≻Bfor input x),\\ndespite preferences being a kind of data that is relatively\\nscarce and expensive to collect in the real world (Casper\\net al., 2023). This is largely because the alignment methods\\nshown to work best—RLHF (Christiano et al., 2017) and', 'proxy, done by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of\\nthe human preference data:\\nLR(rϕ) =Ex,yw,yl∼D[−logσ(rϕ(x, yw)−rϕ(x, yl))]\\nBut solely maximizing the reward might come at the ex-\\npense of desiderata such as generating grammatical text. To\\navoid this, a KL divergence penalty is introduced to restrict\\nhow far the language model can drift from πref. Where πθis\\nthe model we are optimizing, the optimal model π∗is that\\nwhich maximizes\\nEx∈D,y∈πθ[rϕ(x, y)]−βD KL(πθ(y|x)∥πref(y|x))(2)\\nwhere β > 0is a hyperparameter. Since this objective is\\nnot differentiable, we need to use an RL algorithm like PPO\\n(Schulman et al., 2017).\\n2Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\\nHowever, RLHF is often slow (largely because of having\\nto sample generations) and quite unstable in practice (espe-\\ncially in a distributed setting). For this reason, recent work\\nhas focused on designing closed-form losses that maximize\\nthe margin between the preferred and dispreferred gener-\\nations, such as Sequence-Likelihood Calibration (SLiC)\\n(Zhao et al., 2023) and Direct Preference Optimization\\n(DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). The latter has become popular\\ndue to its mathematical equivalence with RLHF:\\nLDPO(πθ, πref) =\\nE\\x14\\n−logσ\\x12\\nβlogπθ(yw|x)\\nπref(yw|x)−βlogπθ(yl|x)\\nπref(yl|x)\\x13\\x15(3)\\n3. A Prospect Theoretic View of Alignment\\nKahneman & Tversky’s prospect theory explains why, faced\\nwith an uncertain event, humans make decisions that do not\\nmaximize the expected value (1992). For example, because\\nhumans are loss-averse, given a gamble that returns $100\\nwith 80% probability and $0 with 20% probability, a person\\nmight accept $60 to avoid the gamble, despite their certainty\\nequivalent of$60 being less than the expected value of $80.\\n3.1. Prospect Theory\\nIn prospect theory, human utility depends on a value func-\\ntionand a weighting function :2\\nDefinition 3.1.

However, this\\nprocess is slow (due to having to sample generations),\\nso we choose to use offline data instead. Because\\nRLHF is also quite unstable in a distributed setting, we\\nnever update πoldand keep it as πref, instead clipping\\nless conservatively than we traditionally would (see\\nAppendix B for details). Baheti et al. (2023) found that\\nthese changes, along with treating the entire output\\nsequence as a single action, greatly improves stability.\\nHowever, since RLHF has historically calculated token-\\nlevel advantages, we omit the third change and only\\npreserve the first two. The PPO-Clip loss itself is left\\nunchanged and is therefore a HALO (Proposition 3.5).\\nCalling this method PPO is somewhat imprecise, be-\\ncause it is offline and takes only one step, but to avoid\\nintroducing too many new terms, we will call this PPO\\n(offline) . Instead of using learned rewards, we simplify\\neven further and use dummy +1/-1 rewards for ywand\\nylinstead. Further details on the implementation of\\nthis method can be found in Appendix B.\\nWe compare these baselines on a suite of 7 models spanning\\ntwo model families, Pythia- {1.4B, 2.8B, 6.9B, 12B }(Bi-\\nderman et al., 2023) and Llama- {7B, 13B, 30B }(Touvron\\net al., 2023). This permits us to see how LLM alignment\\nscales within a model family (Llama-2 lacks a 30B model,', 'us to directly optimize for utility instead of maximizing the\\nlog-likelihood of preferences.

Derivation\\nFrom prior work (Go et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2019; Peters\\n& Schaal, 2007), we know that the policy that maximizes\\nthe KL-constrained RLHF objective in (2) is\\nπ∗(y|x) =1\\nZ(x)πref(y|x) exp\\x121\\nβr∗(x, y)\\x13\\nwhere Z(x)is a partition function.

Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) is as good or better than DPO at all scales, both when preceded and not preceded by\\nsupervised finetuning (SFT). In fact, for the Llama models, KTO alone matches the performance of SFT+DPO and is significantly better\\nthan DPO alone. Error bars denote a 90% binomial confidence interval.\\nInstead, we plug this expression into the Kahneman-Tversky\\nmodel of human utility, with some changes to make it more\\namenable to the LLM setting:\\n1.The exponent in the Kahneman-Tversky value func-\\ntion (4) makes it difficult to optimize, so we set vKTO\\nto be the logistic function σ, which is also concave\\nin gains and convex in losses.

The Phi-2 experiments also suggest\\nthat when data curation is performed at a human-expert level\\n(e.g., by textbook editors), models can outperform baselines\\nthat are up to 25x larger (Javaheripi et al., 2023).\\nData curation routines can be fundamentally characterized\\nas selecting training samples for quality, coverage, or some\\nmixture of both (Figure 2). In this work, we seek to under-\\nstand how quality and coverage affect the data efficiency of\\nLLM pre-training.

Contributions\\nWe hypothesize that the roles of coverage and quality de-\\npend on the stage of training, size of the model, and the\\nsampling rate. To understand the coverage/quality design\\nchoice better, we develop new data-efficiency routines that\\nindependently (and solely) target quality and coverage.

Our\\nASK-LLM results raise important questions about whether\\nLLM-based filters can function as an intervention in the\\nself-consumption loop, allowing LLMs to self-improve.\\n6.

Engstrom et al. (2024) consider a\\nquality evaluation based on datamodels, though their anal-\\nysis suggests that this approach selects for strongly model-\\ndependent notions of quality.\\n3. Methods\\nWe propose two samplers, ASK-LLM andDENSITY . These\\nsamplers have significantly different costs— ASK-LLM re-\\nquires an LLM inference call for each training sample,\\nwhereas DENSITY is based on a diversified sampling rou-\\ntine that is cheaper than even clustering the dataset.

By study-\\ning samplers on extreme ends of this spectrum, we hope to\\nbetter understand the salient factors for LLM data curation.\\n3.1. A SK-LLM Sampling\\nIntuition. Our intuition is that humans can easily identify\\ncommonly occurring failure modes in state-of-the-art data\\nquality scorers. Hence, it should be possible to correct\\nthese mistakes using the reasoning capabilities of modern\\ninstruction-tuned LLMs.\\nTo do so, in ASK-LLM , we prompt an instruction-tuned\\n3How to Train Data-Efficient LLMs\\nAsk-LLM prompt \\n### \\nThis is a pretraining …. datapoint. \\n### \\nDoes the previous paragraph demarcated within ### and ### \\ncontain informative signal for pre-training a large-language model? \\nAn informative datapoint should be well-formatted, contain some \\nusable knowledge of the world, and strictly NOT have any harmful, \\nracist, sexist, etc. content. \\nOPTIONS: \\n- yes \\n- no \\nSampling score  = P(“yes” | prompt) \\nFigure 3.

We take the softmax probability of the\\ntoken “ yes” as the estimated data-quality score. Consider\\nthe following common failure modes of perplexity filter-\\ning, which the ASK-LLM scoring model fixes (see more\\nqualitative examples in Appendix E).\\nContextuality. Perplexity filters often select samples that\\nlack context, e.g., containing questions without answers\\n(Examples 11, 12, 15). ASK-LLM correctly identifies that\\nthese examples do not provide new information.\\nNonsense. Perplexity filters can select examples that end-\\nlessly repeat the same phrases / words (Examples 14 and\\n15), likely because these word combinations are common\\n(resulting in high likelihood).\\nNiche examples. Perplexity filters can reject niche topics\\nthat are otherwise informative, well-written, and contain\\nuseful tail knowledge of the world. Example 17 contains\\ndetailed information about a Manchester art installation\\nbut is assigned a high perplexity, likely because it contains\\nuncommon (but valid) word combinations. Examples 20-22\\ndisplay similar behavior for other niche topics.\\n3.2. D ENSITY Sampling\\nIntuition. Our intuition is that the data distribution provides\\na strong coverage signal. High-probability regions contain\\n“prototypical” examples—ones with many near-duplicates\\nand strong representation in the dataset. Low-probability\\nregions will contain outliers, noise, and unique/rare inputs.\\nIf we wish to maximize topic coverage, we should boost the\\nsignal from under-represented portions of the input domain\\nand downsample redundant, high-density information.\\nThe key difficulty for our DENSITY sampler is to accurately\\nestimate an example’s local density. Like Tirumala et al.\\n(2023) (D4), we assume access to embeddings from a pre-trained LLM. However, we depart from the traditional ap-', 'to include a variety of practical heuristics.\\nFor example, the selection-via-proxy (SVP) algorithm de-\\ntermines the importance of an input using the validation\\nloss and uncertainty scores of a pre-trained model on the\\ninput (Coleman et al., 2020; Sachdeva et al., 2021). Paul\\net al. (2021) sample according to an “EL2N score” formed\\nby ensembling the losses of 10 lightly-trained models. En-\\nsemble prediction variance has also been used as the scoringmetric (Chitta et al., 2021), as have ensemble disagreement\\nrates (Meding et al., 2021). Other scores measure whether\\nan example is likely to be forgotten (Toneva et al., 2019),\\nmemorized (Feldman & Zhang, 2020), or un-learnable (Min-\\ndermann et al., 2022).\\nIn the context of pre-training LLMs, there exist a few dif-\\nferent schools-of-thought for scoring the quality of train-\\ning samples. The first (and arguably most used) camp is\\nperplexity-filtering, where we prioritize samples with low\\nperplexity and filter out highly surprising examples (Wen-\\nzek et al., 2019; Marion et al., 2023; Muennighoff et al.,\\n2023). Notably, recent advancements in cheaper to run\\nmodel-based training-run simulators for LLMs can be used\\ntoestimate the perplexity of a training sample instead of run-\\nning an LLM inference (Guu et al., 2023). Another group\\nof methods selects training data that minimizes the distance\\nbetween the distribution of selected data and a handcrafted\\nhigh-quality data source (typically wikipedia and books).\\nTypical ways are to do this in a feature space (Xie et al.,\\n2023b) or by training a contrastive-style classifer (Radford\\net al., 2019; Anil et al., 2023; Javaheripi et al., 2023). Sim-\\nilar ideas have also been explored for optimizing the data\\nmixture weights for pre-training (Xie et al., 2023a).\\nIn concurrent work, Maini et al. (2024) also consider an\\nLLM-based approach similar to our ASK-LLM sampler,\\nbut with a focus on data paraphrasing rather than selection\\nvia quality evaluation. Engstrom et al. (2024) consider a', 'cal information to the sampler not present in perplexity:\\nASK-LLM scores show no correlation with the perplex-\\nity scores. Based on this clear behavioral difference, we\\nconclude that reasoning and context are crucial ingredients.\\nWe expect prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought\\nreasoning (Wei et al., 2022) to further drive performance.\\n4.5. When are expensive quality scores justified?\\nFigures 4c and 4f suggest that coverage scores—especially\\nthose provided by DENSITY —perform well in the mid-\\ndata regime (roughly 25% to 50% sampling rate). On\\nthe other hand, expensive quality scoring—via the ASK-\\nLLM procedure—is Pareto optimal for the entire quantity-\\nquality trade-off. The higher costs of LLM-based filters\\nare most justified in two scenarios: (i) improving full-data\\nperformance, where quality filtering by removing the lowest-\\nquality data is the main way to push the upper limit of model\\nperformance; or (ii) in the low-data regime, where keeping\\nonly the highest-quality data drives the most model perfor-\\nmance compared to other sampling strategies.\\nWe also observe that random sampling is a strong baseline,\\naligning with recent observations in the literature. Guo\\net al. (2022a) found that only three methods outperformed\\nrandom sampling in a computer vision benchmark of 15\\nalgorithms. Ayed & Hayou (2023a) prove the existence of\\nadversarial problem instances where score-based samplingcannot outperform random sampling.

Related Work\\nData selection is a classical problem with well-established\\nliterature on coresets, sketching, importance sampling, filter-\\ning, denoising, and a host of other algorithms with similar\\ngoals. While we cannot possibly catalog the entire sampling\\nliterature, we hope to provide an overview of the principles\\nbehind common data selection algorithms. We also describe\\nhow these algorithms have been applied to machine learning,\\nwith a focus on language model training.\\n2.1. Coverage Sampling\\nThe first class of methods maximize the coverage of the\\nsample by selecting points that are evenly distributed across\\nthe entire input domain, e.g., an ϵ-net for a Lipschitz func-\\ntion (Phillips, 2017). When training language models, cov-\\nerage sampling is motivated by the intuition that we ought\\nto show the model the full breadth of genres, topics, and\\nlanguages (Longpre et al., 2023b). Coverage sampling is\\ntypically accomplished by embedding examples into a met-\\nric space and selecting points which are mutually far from\\neach other (Lee et al., 2023).\\nCluster sampling algorithms group inputs based on embed-\\nding similarity and select representatives from each group.\\nThese algorithms are popular, scalable, interpretable, and\\nenjoy strong theoretical support – k-means sampling prov-\\nably approximates the SVM objective (Tukan et al., 2021)\\n2How to Train Data-Efficient LLMs\\nCoverageQualityAsk-LLM\\nPerplexity\\nPrototypes\\nSemDeDup\\nDensityDPPs\\nFigure 2. While there is no inherent tradeoff between coverage and\\nquality, samplers target these metrics on a spectrum (up and to the\\nleft indicates a more aggressive prioritization).

ASK-LLM consistently outperforms\\ntraining on the full dataset as well as perplexity filtering\\n(and coverage-maximizing baselines), despite having accessto a scoring model of the same model capacity (XL). Similar\\nfindings hold true for training efficiency (Figure 5).

We believe its excellent performance and compact size make it an attractive platform for\\nresearchers and practitioners in language model research.\\n2 Pretraining\\nThis section describes how we pre-trained TinyLlama. First, we introduce the details of the pre-\\ntraining corpus and the data sampling method. Next, we elaborate on the model architecture and the\\nhyperparameters used during pretraining.\\n2.1 Pre-training data\\nOur main objective is to make the pre-training process effective and reproducible. We adopt a mixture\\nof natural language data and code data to pre-train TinyLlama, sourcing natural language data from\\nSlimPajama (Soboleva et al., 2023) and code data from Starcoderdata (Li et al., 2023). We adopt\\nLlama’s tokenizer (Touvron et al., 2023a) to process the data.\\nSlimPajama This is a large open-source corpus created for training language models based on\\nRedPajama (Together Computer, 2023). The original RedPajama corpus is an open-source research\\neffort aimed at reproducing Llama’s pretraining data (Touvron et al., 2023a) containing over 1.2\\ntrillion tokens. The SlimPajama was derived by cleaning and deduplicating the original RedPajama.\\nStarcoderdata This dataset was collected to train StarCoder (Li et al., 2023), a powerful open-\\nsource large code language model. It comprises approximately 250 billion tokens across 86 program-\\nming languages. In addition to code, it also includes GitHub issues and text-code pairs that involve\\nnatural languages. To avoid data duplication, we remove the GitHub subset of the SlimPajama and\\nonly sample code data from the Starcoderdata.\\nAfter combining these two corpora, we have approximately 950 billion tokens for pre-training in total.', 'only sample code data from the Starcoderdata.\\nAfter combining these two corpora, we have approximately 950 billion tokens for pre-training in total.\\nTinyLlama is trained on these tokens for approximately three epochs, as observed by Muennighoff\\net al. (2023), where training on data repeated for up to four epochs results in minimal performance\\ndegradation compared to using unique data. During training, we sample the natural language data to\\nachieve a ratio of around 7:3 between natural language data and code data.\\n2.2 Architecture\\nWe adopt a similar model architecture to Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b). We use a Transformer\\narchitecture based on Vaswani et al.

In addition, we apply RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) as our\\nnormalization technique, which can improve training efficiency.\\nSwiGLU Instead of using the traditional ReLU non-linearity, we follow Llama 2 and combine\\nSwish and Gated Linear Unit together, which is referred to as SwiGLU (Shazeer, 2020), as our\\nactivation function in TinyLlama.\\nGrouped-query Attention To reduce memory bandwidth overhead and speed up inference, we use\\ngrouped-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023) in our model.

With this technique, the model can share key and value\\nrepresentations across multiple heads without sacrificing much performance.', 'mance of Pythia-1.4B is also included in the figure for comparison.\\nProblem-solving evaluation We also evaluate TinyLlama’s problem-solving capabilities using the\\nInstructEval benchmark (Chia et al., 2023). This benchmark includes the following tasks:\\n•Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) (Hendrycks et al., 2021): This task is\\nused to measure a model’s world knowledge and problem-solving capabilities across various\\nsubjects. We evaluate the models in a 5-shot setting.\\n•BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) (Suzgun et al., 2023): This is a subset of 23 challenging tasks from\\nthe BIG-Bench benchmark (Srivastava et al., 2022) designed to measure a language model’s\\nabilities in complex instruction following.

Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) pre-trained on extensive text corpora have demonstrated their effectiveness\\non a wide range of tasks (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023b). Some empirical studies demonstrated\\nemergent abilities in LLMs, abilities that may only manifest in models with a sufficiently large number\\nof parameters, such as few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020) and chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei\\net al., 2022). Other studies focus on modeling the scaling behavior of LLMs (Kaplan et al., 2020;\\nHoffmann et al., 2022). Hoffmann et al. (2022) suggest that, to train a compute-optimal model, the\\nsize of the model and the amount of training data should be increased at the same rate. This provides\\na guideline on how to optimally select the model size and allocate the amount of training data when\\nthe compute budget is fixed.', 'We build our framework based on lit-gpt.3In adhering to Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), we employ\\nan autoregressive language modeling objective during the pretraining phase.

We assign weight decay as 0.1, and use\\na gradient clipping threshold of 1.0 to regulate the gradient value. We pretrain TinyLlama with 16\\nA100-40G GPUs in our project.\\n3 Results\\nWe evaluate TinyLlama on a wide range of commonsense reasoning and problem-solving tasks and\\ncompare it with several existing open-source language models with similar model parameters.\\nBaseline models We primarily focus on language models with a decoder-only architecture, compris-\\ning approximately 1 billion parameters. Specifically, we compare TinyLlama with OPT-1.3B (Zhang\\net al., 2022), Pythia-1.0B, and Pythia-1.4B (Biderman et al., 2023).\\nCommonsense reasoning tasks To understand the commonsense reasoning ability of TinyLlama,\\nwe consider the following tasks: Hellaswag (Zellers et al., 2019), OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al.,\\n2018), WinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021), ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge (Clark et al., 2018),\\nBoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), and PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020). We adopt the Language Model Evaluation\\nHarness framework (Gao et al., 2023) to evaluate the models.

The results are presented', 'et al., 2023), the models are evaluated in a zero-shot setting on these tasks. The results are presented\\nin Table 2.

We conduct a set of ablations of our framework to identify which factors play\\nkey roles. We evaluate two model variants trained differently than our model: No Retriever trains an\\nLM using the standard instruction-following method given instruction-output pairs, without retrieved\\npassages; No Critic trains an LM trained with input-output pairs that are always augmented with the\\ntop one retrieved document without reflection tokens. This is similar to SAIL (Luo et al., 2023), and\\nwe use our instruction-output data instead of using the Alpaca dataset (Dubois et al., 2023), as in\\nSAIL. We also conduct ablation on our inference-time algorithm, including No retrieval disables\\nretrieval during inference; Hard constraints indicates the model performance that retrieves when\\nRetrieve =Yes instead of using the adaptive threshold; Retrieve top 1 always retrieves and uses the\\ntop one document only, similar to standard RAG approaches; Remove ISSUPindicates the model\\nperformance that removes ISSUPscore only during critique-guided beam search in Eq. 4. In this\\nablation experiment, we use a training instance size of 50k for a more efficient exploration of training', 'factual accuracy (Min et al., 2023), we aim for the model to retrieve passages more frequently to\\nensure that the output aligns closely with the available evidence. Conversely, in more open-ended\\ntasks, like composing a personal experience essay, the emphasis shifts towards retrieving less and\\nprioritizing the overall creativity or utility score. In this section, we describe approaches to enforce\\ncontrol to meet these distinct objectives during the inference process.\\nAdaptive retrieval with threshold.

However, there are also some limitations\\nsuch as unstable performance in low-shot settings,\\nand the fact that providing more in-context examples\\ndoes not consistently improve performance.\\nTo learn a better retriever and enhance the bidirec-\\ntional understanding ability of the reader, as demon-\\nstrated in Izacard et al. (2023), a practical choice is to\\npretrain the model with the masked language mod-\\neling objective, where the input is a corrupted text\\nwith several masked spans placed randomly within\\nthe sequence (refer to Figure 1 (left) for an example).\\nHowever, in testing, based on our analysis in §3.1\\nand Appendix C.1, it is most effective to place the tar-\\nget question after all the in-context examples, with a\\nmasked token (i.e., <extra id0>) following the ques-\\ntion (Figure 1, middle)). Thus, there exists a mismatch between pretraining and inference.\\nTo solve this issue, we propose combining retrieval-augmented masked and prefix language\\nmodeling. Specifically, in the first stage, the retriever and reader are trained jointly with\\nretrieval-augmented masked language modeling. The training objective for the retriever is\\nto minimize the KL divergence KL(pREADER ∥pRETRIEVER )between the passage posterior\\ndistribution according to the reader and the passage distribution from the retriever over\\nthe top-K retrieved passages, i.e., pREADER (d) =exp(logpLM(a|d,q))\\n∑K\\ni=1exp(logpLM(a|di,q)),pRETRIEVER (d) =\\nexp(s(d,q)/T)\\n∑K\\ni=1exp(s(di,q)/T), where s(·)calculates the dot product between the query qand passage d\\nvectors, and Tis a hyperparameter. The training objective for the reader is to maximize the\\nlikelihood of the masked spans with nretrieved passages: ∑ilogp(ai|q,{dk}1,...,n,a1:i−1).\\nIn the second stage, for each sequence, we mask 10% of the tokens on average at the end of\\nthe sequence with the <extra id0>token. Then, we use the retriever obtained from the first\\n5In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models', '6In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 8>8\\n# In-Context Examples2628303234Natural Questions, EM\\nRAVEN 11B\\n + FICL\\nATLAS 11B\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 8>8\\n# In-Context Examples56586062646668TriviaQA, EM\\nFigure 5: RAVEN vsATLAS .

Following the setup in §3.1, we first evaluate on two widely-used open-domain\\nquestion answering datasets: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and Trivi-\\naQA (Joshi et al., 2017). Additionally, we conduct a case study on long-form question\\nanswering using the ELI5 dataset (Fan et al., 2019). Furthermore, we assess the models’\\nlanguage understanding ability using the Massively Multitask Language Understanding\\n(MMLU) benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021). Detailed information regarding the MMLU\\nevaluation is in Appendix B.5. Other evaluation settings are the same as §B.1.\\nBaselines. Since both RAVEN and ATLAS (Izacard et al., 2023) are trained starting from T5,\\nwe choose ATLAS as a primary baseline for comparison. We also compare our model with\\ndecoder-only LLMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), and\\nLLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) (in a closed-book setting). Additionally, for open-domain\\nQA, we evaluate our approach against REPLUG (Shi et al., 2023) and RETRO (Borgeaud\\net al., 2022), as well as its improved version RETRO ++(Wang et al., 2023). These models are\\ndecoder-only language models augmented with retrieval.

One of the key features that enables these models to excel is their ability to\\nperform in-context learning (Dong et al., 2022). By conditioning on given context, LLMs can\\nadapt to new tasks and domains without the need for task-specific fine-tuning. This enables\\nLLMs to perform well on zero-shot or few-shot learning tasks, where only a limited number\\nof examples are available.\\nWhile in-context learning has been extensively studied for decoder-only language models\\nlike GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) and PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), research on encoder-\\ndecoder language models, which have shown to learn stronger representations (Devlin et al.,\\n2019; Raffel et al., 2020), remains limited.

These models have demonstrated remarkable\\nperformance across a wide range of tasks (Qin et al., 2023; Bubeck et al., 2023; Huang &\\nChang, 2023). One of the key features that enables these models to excel is their ability to\\nperform in-context learning (Dong et al., 2022). By conditioning on given context, LLMs can', 'While there has been some research on in-context learning with retrieval-augmented\\ndecoder-only LMs, which can be straightforwardly implemented by concatenating retrieved\\npassages with the query as the input of the LM (Mallen et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2023; Khattab\\net al., 2022), in-context learning with retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder LMs remains\\nunexplored to the best of our knowledge. This is despite the fact that encoder-decoder LMs\\ncan be more efficient at incorporating multiple (e.g., 40) retrieved passages.\\n1RAVEN , a bird known for its intelligence and adaptability, has the letters “RA” in its name, which\\nrepresents “ Retrieval- Augmented” in our context.\\n2In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models', 'may be attributed to two factors: 1) the sequence length constraints during pretraining,\\nwhere the maximum input length to the encoder is set to 384 tokens, and the average input\\nsequence length (excluding passages) is around 130 tokens; 2) the model’s ability to learn\\nadequately with 5 or 8 examples, making additional examples less beneficial.\\nIn Appendices C.1 and C.2, we also study the effect of the target question’s position and the\\neffect of the number of retrieved passages. We observe that positioning the target question\\nafter all the in-context examples yields the optimal performance. Additionally, for both\\n0-shot and 5-shot settings, the performance of the models increases significantly with the\\nnumber of retrieved passages, with the 5-shot performance consistently outperforming the\\n0-shot setting. This highlights the superiority of the encoder-decoder (Fusion-in-Decoder)\\narchitecture, which offers an advantage not available to decoder-only language models.\\n3.2 R AVEN : Combining Retrieval-Augmented Masked and Prefix Language Modeling\\nInputtoEncoder:Machinelearningalgorithmsbuildamodelbasedonsampledata,knownastrainingdata,inordertomakepredictionsordecisionswithoutbeingexplicitlyprogrammedtodoso.Machinelearningalgorithmsareusedinawidevarietyofapplications,suchasinmedicine,emailfiltering,speechrecognition,agriculture,andcomputervision,whereitisdifficultor<extra_id_0>Passage:…machinelearningmodelsrequireahighquantityofreliabledatainorderforthemodels…InputtoDecoder:NoneOutput:<extra_id_0>unfeasibletodevelopconventionalalgorithmstoperformtheneededtasks.   ��������������������������������������������\\nFigure 3: Retrieval-augmented prefix\\nlanguage modeling.In§3.1, we observe that retrieval-augmented\\nencoder-decoder LMs exhibit a certain ability for in-\\ncontext learning, which has been overlooked in previ-\\nous studies.

Building upon the analysis, we develop models\\nwith enhanced zero-shot performance and improved in-context learning abilities.\\n3.1 In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder LMs\\nTo investigate the in-context learning ability of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder\\nlanguage models, we first aim to gain insights from the state-of-the-art designs in the\\nliterature. Among them, the design of ATLAS (Izacard et al., 2023) stands out; it combines\\na general-purpose dense retriever with a sequence-to-sequence reader (i.e., T5 (Raffel et al.,\\n2020)) using the Fusion-in-Decoder architecture (Izacard & Grave, 2021). The retriever,\\nencoder and decoder are jointly trained during the pretraining process. In this process,\\nthe dense retriever, based on the Contriever model (Izacard et al., 2022), is responsible\\nfor selecting relevant passages from an external knowledge source, e.g., Wikipedia, based\\non the given corrupted context. The retrieved passages are then processed along with the\\ncontext by the encoder, which generates the corresponding output, i.e., the masked spans,\\nat the decoder (Figure 1, left). ATLAS demonstrates exceptional few-shot performance on\\nknowledge-intensive language tasks (Petroni et al., 2021), despite having a lower parameter\\ncount compared to other recent LLMs.\\nHowever, in Izacard et al. (2023), the few-shot performance is achieved by finetuning\\nthe model with few-shot examples, which requires additional training and may limit its\\napplications, such as dealing with dynamic and diverse real-time user queries like GPT-\\n3/4 (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023), where in-context learning plays a vital role. Therefore,\\nwe take the initiative to explore the in-context learning ability of this type of models, using', 'from an external corpus. Among these, the encoder-decoder models, such as ATLAS (Izacard\\net al., 2023), stand out. They benefit from the strong representation ability of a bidirectional\\nencoder, coupled with of the efficacy of a Fusion-in-Decoder architecture (Izacard & Grave,\\n2021), enabling the effective integration of multiple retrieved passages. Despite these\\nadvancements, in-context learning with these models remains underexplored.\\nIn this regard, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art retrieval-\\naugmented encoder-decoder language models by designing and experimenting with differ-\\nent prompting strategies. We find that these models exhibit a certain in-context learning\\nability; however, due to a mismatch between pretraining and inference and a limited context\\nlength—issues that are common to existing encoder-decoder LMs trained with masked\\nlanguage modeling—its few-shot performance is not stable and providing more than, e.g.,\\n8-shot, examples does not lead to further improvement.\\nBased on the analysis, we develop RAVEN1by first mitigating the mismatch between\\npretraining and inference through a combination of retrieval-augmented masked language\\nmodeling and prefix language modeling. Moreover, to enable the model to learn from more\\nin-context examples, we propose Fusion-in-Context Learning , a novel approach that allows\\nthe model to utilize more in-context examples without modifying the model configuration\\nor requiring additional training. Furthermore, we suggest using the retriever of the model to\\nobtain relevant in-context examples to further enhance few-shot performance. Our empirical\\nresults demonstrate that RAVEN significantly outperforms previous retrieval-augmented\\nencoder-decoder LMs in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, even achieving comparable\\nresults to decoder-only LLMs in some settings despite having 180 times fewer parameters.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are twofold:', 'results to decoder-only LLMs in some settings despite having 180 times fewer parameters.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are twofold:\\n•From an analytical standpoint, we provide a thorough analysis of the in-context learning\\nability of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language models.

They not\\nonly enhance the base model’s capabilities but also highlight the potential of in-context\\nlearning with retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder LMs.\\n2 Background and Related Work\\nRetrieval-augmented language models are a class of language models designed to enhance\\ntheir performance by incorporating external knowledge. These models typically employ\\nan information retrieval mechanism to access relevant information from a large corpus,\\nwhich is then integrated into the model’s prediction process. Retrieval-augmented LMs\\ncan be based on both encoder-decoder (Izacard et al., 2023; Lewis et al., 2020) and decoder-\\nonly (Khandelwal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022) architectures. For\\ndecoder-only LMs, the computational cost typically increases quadratically with the input\\nlength, as well as with the number of retrieval passages. In contrast, for encoder-decoder\\nLMs with a Fusion-in-Decoder architecture, the computation cost grows linearly with the\\nnumber of retrieved passages, as they only perform self-attention over one passage at a\\ntime (Izacard & Grave, 2021). This concept is also investigated by Ye et al. (2023) for more\\nefficient in-context learning.\\nWhile there has been some research on in-context learning with retrieval-augmented\\ndecoder-only LMs, which can be straightforwardly implemented by concatenating retrieved', '6In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 8>8\\n# In-Context Examples2628303234Natural Questions, EM\\nRAVEN 11B\\n + FICL\\nATLAS 11B\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 8>8\\n# In-Context Examples56586062646668TriviaQA, EM\\nFigure 5: RAVEN vsATLAS .

Without\\nthis, users would need to manually provide in-context examples; and 2) optimize the\\nselection of in-context examples, thereby improving in-context learning performance.\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Experimental Setup\\nDatasets. Following the setup in §3.1, we first evaluate on two widely-used open-domain\\nquestion answering datasets: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and Trivi-\\naQA (Joshi et al., 2017). Additionally, we conduct a case study on long-form question\\nanswering using the ELI5 dataset (Fan et al., 2019). Furthermore, we assess the models’\\nlanguage understanding ability using the Massively Multitask Language Understanding\\n(MMLU) benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021). Detailed information regarding the MMLU\\nevaluation is in Appendix B.5. Other evaluation settings are the same as §B.1.\\nBaselines. Since both RAVEN and ATLAS (Izacard et al., 2023) are trained starting from T5,\\nwe choose ATLAS as a primary baseline for comparison. We also compare our model with\\ndecoder-only LLMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), and\\nLLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) (in a closed-book setting). Additionally, for open-domain\\nQA, we evaluate our approach against REPLUG (Shi et al., 2023) and RETRO (Borgeaud\\net al., 2022), as well as its improved version RETRO ++(Wang et al., 2023). These models are\\ndecoder-only language models augmented with retrieval. REPLUG is based on Codex (Chen', 'Effect of Number of In-Context Examples. The number of in-context examples is a crucial\\nhyperparameter for in-context learning. Generally, we expect better performance from a\\nmodel with more in-context examples, but there is an upper limit due to 1) the maximum con-\\ntext length setup, e.g., 512 tokens, during the pretraining process, and 2) the point at which\\nthe model has received sufficient examples and cannot gain additional information from\\nmore examples. The optimal number of in-context examples also varies between models.\\nFor instance, on TriviaQA, PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2023) exhibits better 1-shot performance\\nthan settings with more examples, while this is not the case for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020).\\n3Experimental setup is detailed in the Appendix B.1.\\n4In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models\\nFigure 2 illustrates the impact of varying the number of in-context examples across different\\nmodel sizes. Interestingly, the 11B model demonstrates poor performance in low-shot\\nsettings, e.g., 1-shot, but improves significantly after 4-shot and 5-shot. Upon examining the\\ngenerated responses, we find that the model tends to produce answers with more tokens\\nin low-shot settings, while the ground truth typically consists of shorter answers with\\nfewer than 5 tokens. By relaxing the criteria for a correct prediction to include instances\\nwhere the ground-truth answer is a substring of the model output, we find that the 1-shot\\nperformance surpasses that of the 0-shot setting (38.3 vs 32.1 on NQ).\\nAll models perform well in the 5-shot and 8-shot settings, but their performance does not\\ncontinue to improve with more in-context examples (e.g., 16-shot). We believe this plateau\\nmay be attributed to two factors: 1) the sequence length constraints during pretraining,\\nwhere the maximum input length to the encoder is set to 384 tokens, and the average input']   \n",

The size of the model also affects the sampling cost, which in turn impacts the quality and coverage of the pre-trained model.

Us-\\ning experiments that presented real humans with monetary\\ngambles and asked for their certainty equivalent, Tversky &\\nKahneman (1992) proposed the following functional form\\nfor human value:\\nv(z, z ref;λ;α) =(\\n(z−zref)αifz > z ref\\n−λ(zref−z)αifz < z ref(4)\\n2Cumulative prospect theory is the full name of the expanded\\ntheory we dicuss here (Tversky & Kahneman, 1992).\\nFigure 2.

Prospect theory explains why humans make deci-\\nsions about uncertain events that do not maximize expected\\nvalue. It formalizes how humans perceive random variables\\nin a biased but well-defined manner; for example, relative to\\nsome reference point, humans are more sensitive to losses\\nthan gains, a property called loss aversion . We show that\\npopular alignment methods such as PPO (Schulman et al.,\\n2017), DPO (Rafailov et al., 2023), and SLiC (Zhao et al.,\\n2023) implicitly model such biases, helping explain their\\nsuccess independently of the data used. For this reason, we\\ncall them human-aware loss functions (HALOs).\\nAlthough it is impossible to say that HALOs are categori-\\ncally better than non-HALOs, we find that among existing\\nmethods, those that meet the definition of a HALO work\\nbetter than those that do not. We find that DPO perfor-\\nmance can even be matched at most scales by running an\\noffline PPO variant on dummy +1/-1 rewards, suggesting\\nthat preference data might not be needed if the inductive\\nbias in the loss function is good enough. However, despite\\nthe surprising success of this simple baseline, it significantly\\nlags behind DPO at the 30B model scale and suffers from\\nhyperparameter sensitivity, making it difficult to use.\\nTaking a more principled approach, we derive a HALO using\\nthe model of human utility that Kahneman & Tversky empir-Document 6:::\\nKTO: Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\\nKawin Ethayarajh1Winnie Xu2Niklas Muennighoff2Dan Jurafsky1Douwe Kiela1 2\\nAbstract\\nKahneman & Tversky’s prospect theory tells us\\nthat humans perceive random variables in a biased\\nbut well-defined manner (1992); for example, hu-\\nmans are famously loss-averse. We show that\\nobjectives for aligning LLMs with human feed-\\nback implicitly incorporate many of these biases—\\nthe success of these objectives (e.g., DPO) over\\ncross-entropy minimization can partly be ascribed\\nto them being human-aware loss functions (HA-\\nLOs). However, the utility functions these meth-\\nods attribute to humans still differ from those in\\nthe prospect theory literature. Using a Kahneman-\\nTversky model of human utility, we propose a\\nHALO that directly maximizes the utility of gen-\\nerations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood\\nof preferences, as current methods do. We call\\nthis approach Kahneman-Tversky Optimization\\n(KTO), and it matches or exceeds the performance\\nof preference-based methods at scales from 1B to\\n30B. Crucially, KTO does not need preferences—\\nonly a binary signal of whether an output is desir-\\nable or undesirable for a given input. This makes\\nit far easier to use in the real world, where prefer-\\nence data is scarce and expensive.\\n1. Introduction\\nAligning generative models with human feedback has been\\nsuccessfully used to make generations more helpful, factual,\\nand ethical, among other desiderata (Ouyang et al., 2022;\\nTian et al., 2023). For LLMs, alignment methods such\\nas RLHF and DPO have consistently proven to be more\\nbeneficial than doing supervised finetuning (SFT) alone.\\nHowever, human feedback is often discussed only in the\\ncontext of preferences (e.g., output A≻Bfor input x),\\ndespite preferences being a kind of data that is relatively\\nscarce and expensive to collect in the real world (Casper\\net al., 2023). This is largely because the alignment methods\\nshown to work best—RLHF (Christiano et al., 2017) andDocument 7:::\\nproxy, done by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of\\nthe human preference data:\\nLR(rϕ) =Ex,yw,yl∼D[−logσ(rϕ(x, yw)−rϕ(x, yl))]\\nBut solely maximizing the reward might come at the ex-\\npense of desiderata such as generating grammatical text. To\\navoid this, a KL divergence penalty is introduced to restrict\\nhow far the language model can drift from πref. Where πθis\\nthe model we are optimizing, the optimal model π∗is that\\nwhich maximizes\\nEx∈D,y∈πθ[rϕ(x, y)]−βD KL(πθ(y|x)∥πref(y|x))(2)\\nwhere β > 0is a hyperparameter. Since this objective is\\nnot differentiable, we need to use an RL algorithm like PPO\\n(Schulman et al., 2017).\\n2Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\\nHowever, RLHF is often slow (largely because of having\\nto sample generations) and quite unstable in practice (espe-\\ncially in a distributed setting). For this reason, recent work\\nhas focused on designing closed-form losses that maximize\\nthe margin between the preferred and dispreferred gener-\\nations, such as Sequence-Likelihood Calibration (SLiC)\\n(Zhao et al., 2023) and Direct Preference Optimization\\n(DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023). The latter has become popular\\ndue to its mathematical equivalence with RLHF:\\nLDPO(πθ, πref) =\\nE\u0014\\n−logσ\u0012\\nβlogπθ(yw|x)\\nπref(yw|x)−βlogπθ(yl|x)\\nπref(yl|x)\u0013\u0015(3)\\n3. A Prospect Theoretic View of Alignment\\nKahneman & Tversky’s prospect theory explains why, faced\\nwith an uncertain event, humans make decisions that do not\\nmaximize the expected value (1992). For example, because\\nhumans are loss-averse, given a gamble that returns $100\\nwith 80% probability and $0 with 20% probability, a person\\nmight accept $60 to avoid the gamble, despite their certainty\\nequivalent of$60 being less than the expected value of $80.\\n3.1. Prospect Theory\\nIn prospect theory, human utility depends on a value func-\\ntionand a weighting function :2\\nDefinition 3.1. Avalue function v:z→Rmaps an out-\\ncome z, relative to some reference point zref, to its perceivedDocument 8:::\\ntheLregterm is the standard language modeling loss.\\n3.DPO : DPO, as defined in (3), is a HALO loss (Propo-\\nsition 3.5).4.PPO (offline) : The standard RLHF objective in (2) is\\ntypically optimized with PPO-Clip, which works by\\n“clipping” how far πθcan drift from the version πoldat\\nthe previous step:\\nLPPO (offline) =−Ex,y,t∼D[min( qθA(x, y<t, yt),\\nclip(qθ,1−ϵ,1 +ϵ)A(x, y<t, yt))]\\nwhere qθ= logπθ\\nπoldandA(x, y<t, yt)is the per-token\\nadvantage (i.e., the surplus benefit from producing a\\ngiven token in a given state).\\nPPO is an online algorithm—generations are sampled\\nfrom the current model, judged by a reward model, and\\nthen used to update the current version. However, this\\nprocess is slow (due to having to sample generations),\\nso we choose to use offline data instead. Because\\nRLHF is also quite unstable in a distributed setting, we\\nnever update πoldand keep it as πref, instead clipping\\nless conservatively than we traditionally would (see\\nAppendix B for details). Baheti et al. (2023) found that\\nthese changes, along with treating the entire output\\nsequence as a single action, greatly improves stability.\\nHowever, since RLHF has historically calculated token-\\nlevel advantages, we omit the third change and only\\npreserve the first two. The PPO-Clip loss itself is left\\nunchanged and is therefore a HALO (Proposition 3.5).\\nCalling this method PPO is somewhat imprecise, be-\\ncause it is offline and takes only one step, but to avoid\\nintroducing too many new terms, we will call this PPO\\n(offline) . Instead of using learned rewards, we simplify\\neven further and use dummy +1/-1 rewards for ywand\\nylinstead. Further details on the implementation of\\nthis method can be found in Appendix B.\\nWe compare these baselines on a suite of 7 models spanning\\ntwo model families, Pythia- {1.4B, 2.8B, 6.9B, 12B }(Bi-\\nderman et al., 2023) and Llama- {7B, 13B, 30B }(Touvron\\net al., 2023). This permits us to see how LLM alignment\\nscales within a model family (Llama-2 lacks a 30B model,Document 9:::\\nus to directly optimize for utility instead of maximizing the\\nlog-likelihood of preferences. This Kahneman-Tversky Op-\\ntimization (KTO) loss only needs a binary signal of whether\\nan output is (un)desirable for a given input, giving it access\\nto a source of data is more abundant, cheaper, and faster to\\ncollect in the real world.\\n4.1. Derivation\\nFrom prior work (Go et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2019; Peters\\n& Schaal, 2007), we know that the policy that maximizes\\nthe KL-constrained RLHF objective in (2) is\\nπ∗(y|x) =1\\nZ(x)πref(y|x) exp\u00121\\nβr∗(x, y)\u0013\\nwhere Z(x)is a partition function. Rafailov et al. (2023)\\nrewrite this in terms of the optimal reward for an input-\\noutput pair:\\nr∗(x, y) =βlogπ∗(y|x)\\nπref(y|x)+βlogZ(x) (6)\\nThey then plug this expression into the Bradley-Terry model\\nof preferences and take the negative logarithm of that objec-\\ntive to get the DPO loss (3).\\n5Model Alignment as Prospect Theoretic Optimization\\nFigure 4. Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) is as good or better than DPO at all scales, both when preceded and not preceded by\\nsupervised finetuning (SFT). In fact, for the Llama models, KTO alone matches the performance of SFT+DPO and is significantly better\\nthan DPO alone. Error bars denote a 90% binomial confidence interval.\\nInstead, we plug this expression into the Kahneman-Tversky\\nmodel of human utility, with some changes to make it more\\namenable to the LLM setting:\\n1.The exponent in the Kahneman-Tversky value func-\\ntion (4) makes it difficult to optimize, so we set vKTO\\nto be the logistic function σ, which is also concave\\nin gains and convex in losses. We replace the loss-\\naversion coefficient with two hyperparameters λD, λU\\nthat weight the losses for desirable and undesirable\\noutputs respectively.\\n2.The Kahneman-Tversky value function was derived\\nbased on experiments with humans and monetary gam-\\nbles. Since LLM generations do not have a monetary\\nreward associated with them, we set rKTOto be the\\nimplicit reward under the RLHF objective (6).\\n---\\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\\n\\nQuestion: Given that HALOs are loss functions that model human biases in Tversky & Kahneman (1992), what is the definition of a human-aware loss function according to Definition 3.4 in this context?\\n\\n\\n</s>\\n<|assistant|>\\nIn the context of this paper, a human-aware loss function (HALO) is defined as a loss function that models some of the key cognitive biases that humans exhibit in decision-making under uncertainty, as described by Tversky and Kahneman's prospect theory (1992). Specifically, a HALO is characterized by the existence of a reference point distribution, a value function that is concave in gains and possibly convex in losses, and a negative affine function that represents a loss aversion effect. The paper proposes a new HALO called KTO, which directly maximizes the utility of LLM generations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood of preferences, as current methods do. By using a binary signal of whether an output is desirable or undesirable for a given input, KTO is easier to use in the real world, where preference data is scarce and expensive to collect. The paper also compares the performance of different alignment methods, including DPO and SLiC, and finds that those that meet the definition of a HALO perform better than those that do not.   \n",

Engstrom et al. (2024) consider a\\nquality evaluation based on datamodels, though their anal-\\nysis suggests that this approach selects for strongly model-\\ndependent notions of quality.\\n3. Methods\\nWe propose two samplers, ASK-LLM andDENSITY . These\\nsamplers have significantly different costs— ASK-LLM re-\\nquires an LLM inference call for each training sample,\\nwhereas DENSITY is based on a diversified sampling rou-\\ntine that is cheaper than even clustering the dataset.

By study-\\ning samplers on extreme ends of this spectrum, we hope to\\nbetter understand the salient factors for LLM data curation.\\n3.1. A SK-LLM Sampling\\nIntuition. Our intuition is that humans can easily identify\\ncommonly occurring failure modes in state-of-the-art data\\nquality scorers. Hence, it should be possible to correct\\nthese mistakes using the reasoning capabilities of modern\\ninstruction-tuned LLMs.\\nTo do so, in ASK-LLM , we prompt an instruction-tuned\\n3How to Train Data-Efficient LLMs\\nAsk-LLM prompt \\n### \\nThis is a pretraining …. datapoint. \\n### \\nDoes the previous paragraph demarcated within ### and ### \\ncontain informative signal for pre-training a large-language model? \\nAn informative datapoint should be well-formatted, contain some \\nusable knowledge of the world, and strictly NOT have any harmful, \\nracist, sexist, etc. content. \\nOPTIONS: \\n- yes \\n- no \\nSampling score  = P(“yes” | prompt) \\nFigure 3.

We take the softmax probability of the\\ntoken “ yes” as the estimated data-quality score. Consider\\nthe following common failure modes of perplexity filter-\\ning, which the ASK-LLM scoring model fixes (see more\\nqualitative examples in Appendix E).\\nContextuality. Perplexity filters often select samples that\\nlack context, e.g., containing questions without answers\\n(Examples 11, 12, 15). ASK-LLM correctly identifies that\\nthese examples do not provide new information.\\nNonsense. Perplexity filters can select examples that end-\\nlessly repeat the same phrases / words (Examples 14 and\\n15), likely because these word combinations are common\\n(resulting in high likelihood).\\nNiche examples. Perplexity filters can reject niche topics\\nthat are otherwise informative, well-written, and contain\\nuseful tail knowledge of the world. Example 17 contains\\ndetailed information about a Manchester art installation\\nbut is assigned a high perplexity, likely because it contains\\nuncommon (but valid) word combinations. Examples 20-22\\ndisplay similar behavior for other niche topics.\\n3.2. D ENSITY Sampling\\nIntuition. Our intuition is that the data distribution provides\\na strong coverage signal. High-probability regions contain\\n“prototypical” examples—ones with many near-duplicates\\nand strong representation in the dataset. Low-probability\\nregions will contain outliers, noise, and unique/rare inputs.\\nIf we wish to maximize topic coverage, we should boost the\\nsignal from under-represented portions of the input domain\\nand downsample redundant, high-density information.\\nThe key difficulty for our DENSITY sampler is to accurately\\nestimate an example’s local density. Like Tirumala et al.\\n(2023) (D4), we assume access to embeddings from a pre-trained LLM. However, we depart from the traditional ap-Document 6:::\\nto include a variety of practical heuristics.\\nFor example, the selection-via-proxy (SVP) algorithm de-\\ntermines the importance of an input using the validation\\nloss and uncertainty scores of a pre-trained model on the\\ninput (Coleman et al., 2020; Sachdeva et al., 2021). Paul\\net al. (2021) sample according to an “EL2N score” formed\\nby ensembling the losses of 10 lightly-trained models. En-\\nsemble prediction variance has also been used as the scoringmetric (Chitta et al., 2021), as have ensemble disagreement\\nrates (Meding et al., 2021). Other scores measure whether\\nan example is likely to be forgotten (Toneva et al., 2019),\\nmemorized (Feldman & Zhang, 2020), or un-learnable (Min-\\ndermann et al., 2022).\\nIn the context of pre-training LLMs, there exist a few dif-\\nferent schools-of-thought for scoring the quality of train-\\ning samples. The first (and arguably most used) camp is\\nperplexity-filtering, where we prioritize samples with low\\nperplexity and filter out highly surprising examples (Wen-\\nzek et al., 2019; Marion et al., 2023; Muennighoff et al.,\\n2023). Notably, recent advancements in cheaper to run\\nmodel-based training-run simulators for LLMs can be used\\ntoestimate the perplexity of a training sample instead of run-\\nning an LLM inference (Guu et al., 2023). Another group\\nof methods selects training data that minimizes the distance\\nbetween the distribution of selected data and a handcrafted\\nhigh-quality data source (typically wikipedia and books).\\nTypical ways are to do this in a feature space (Xie et al.,\\n2023b) or by training a contrastive-style classifer (Radford\\net al., 2019; Anil et al., 2023; Javaheripi et al., 2023). Sim-\\nilar ideas have also been explored for optimizing the data\\nmixture weights for pre-training (Xie et al., 2023a).\\nIn concurrent work, Maini et al. (2024) also consider an\\nLLM-based approach similar to our ASK-LLM sampler,\\nbut with a focus on data paraphrasing rather than selection\\nvia quality evaluation. Engstrom et al. (2024) consider aDocument 7:::\\ncal information to the sampler not present in perplexity:\\nASK-LLM scores show no correlation with the perplex-\\nity scores. Based on this clear behavioral difference, we\\nconclude that reasoning and context are crucial ingredients.\\nWe expect prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought\\nreasoning (Wei et al., 2022) to further drive performance.\\n4.5. When are expensive quality scores justified?\\nFigures 4c and 4f suggest that coverage scores—especially\\nthose provided by DENSITY —perform well in the mid-\\ndata regime (roughly 25% to 50% sampling rate). On\\nthe other hand, expensive quality scoring—via the ASK-\\nLLM procedure—is Pareto optimal for the entire quantity-\\nquality trade-off. The higher costs of LLM-based filters\\nare most justified in two scenarios: (i) improving full-data\\nperformance, where quality filtering by removing the lowest-\\nquality data is the main way to push the upper limit of model\\nperformance; or (ii) in the low-data regime, where keeping\\nonly the highest-quality data drives the most model perfor-\\nmance compared to other sampling strategies.\\nWe also observe that random sampling is a strong baseline,\\naligning with recent observations in the literature. Guo\\net al. (2022a) found that only three methods outperformed\\nrandom sampling in a computer vision benchmark of 15\\nalgorithms. Ayed & Hayou (2023a) prove the existence of\\nadversarial problem instances where score-based samplingcannot outperform random sampling. These results only\\nserve to highlight the significance of A SK-LLM’s gains.\\n4.6. Effect of quality-scoring model capacity\\nFigure 6 demonstrates a clear scaling trend for ASK-LLM ’s\\nquality-scoring model: larger scoring models are increas-\\ningly beneficial as the scale of the to-be-trained LLM in-\\ncreases. Perplexity filters do not seem to exhibit such trends.\\nThe strongly consistent scaling for ASK-LLM also suggests\\nan interesting performance-recipe: to improve downstream\\ndata-efficiency, use better quality-scoring models. CreatingDocument 8:::\\nsampling cost on downstream performance.\\nTakeaway. Our results show that while coverage sampling\\ncanrecover the performance of the full data, ASK-LLM\\n(quality filtering) can often exceed it. These experiments\\nsuggest that LLM-based quality raters are a worthwhile and\\neffective way to drive performance in pre-training.\\n2. Related Work\\nData selection is a classical problem with well-established\\nliterature on coresets, sketching, importance sampling, filter-\\ning, denoising, and a host of other algorithms with similar\\ngoals. While we cannot possibly catalog the entire sampling\\nliterature, we hope to provide an overview of the principles\\nbehind common data selection algorithms. We also describe\\nhow these algorithms have been applied to machine learning,\\nwith a focus on language model training.\\n2.1. Coverage Sampling\\nThe first class of methods maximize the coverage of the\\nsample by selecting points that are evenly distributed across\\nthe entire input domain, e.g., an ϵ-net for a Lipschitz func-\\ntion (Phillips, 2017). When training language models, cov-\\nerage sampling is motivated by the intuition that we ought\\nto show the model the full breadth of genres, topics, and\\nlanguages (Longpre et al., 2023b). Coverage sampling is\\ntypically accomplished by embedding examples into a met-\\nric space and selecting points which are mutually far from\\neach other (Lee et al., 2023).\\nCluster sampling algorithms group inputs based on embed-\\nding similarity and select representatives from each group.\\nThese algorithms are popular, scalable, interpretable, and\\nenjoy strong theoretical support – k-means sampling prov-\\nably approximates the SVM objective (Tukan et al., 2021)\\n2How to Train Data-Efficient LLMs\\nCoverageQualityAsk-LLM\\nPerplexity\\nPrototypes\\nSemDeDup\\nDensityDPPs\\nFigure 2.

ASK-LLM consistently outperforms\\ntraining on the full dataset as well as perplexity filtering\\n(and coverage-maximizing baselines), despite having accessto a scoring model of the same model capacity (XL). Similar\\nfindings hold true for training efficiency (Figure 5).

The paper \"How to Train Data-Efficient LLMs\" finds that coverage sampling can recover the performance of the full data, but LLM-based quality filters, such as the Ask-LLM sampler, can often exceed it, especially for larger models. This is because for smaller models, coverage sampling is sufficient to reach the upper limit of model performance, but for larger models, high-quality data becomes increasingly important. The paper also notes that random sampling is a strong baseline, but LLM-based quality raters are a worthwhile and effective way to drive performance in pre-training, as demonstrated by the Ask-LLM sampler's consistent outperformance of training on the full dataset and perplexity filtering, despite having access to a scoring model of the same model capacity (XL). The paper suggests that creating better quality-scoring models can improve downstream data-efficiency, as demonstrated by the scaling trend for Ask-LLM's quality-scoring model.   \n",

We believe its excellent performance and compact size make it an attractive platform for\\nresearchers and practitioners in language model research.\\n2 Pretraining\\nThis section describes how we pre-trained TinyLlama. First, we introduce the details of the pre-\\ntraining corpus and the data sampling method. Next, we elaborate on the model architecture and the\\nhyperparameters used during pretraining.\\n2.1 Pre-training data\\nOur main objective is to make the pre-training process effective and reproducible. We adopt a mixture\\nof natural language data and code data to pre-train TinyLlama, sourcing natural language data from\\nSlimPajama (Soboleva et al., 2023) and code data from Starcoderdata (Li et al., 2023). We adopt\\nLlama’s tokenizer (Touvron et al., 2023a) to process the data.\\nSlimPajama This is a large open-source corpus created for training language models based on\\nRedPajama (Together Computer, 2023). The original RedPajama corpus is an open-source research\\neffort aimed at reproducing Llama’s pretraining data (Touvron et al., 2023a) containing over 1.2\\ntrillion tokens. The SlimPajama was derived by cleaning and deduplicating the original RedPajama.\\nStarcoderdata This dataset was collected to train StarCoder (Li et al., 2023), a powerful open-\\nsource large code language model. It comprises approximately 250 billion tokens across 86 program-\\nming languages. In addition to code, it also includes GitHub issues and text-code pairs that involve\\nnatural languages. To avoid data duplication, we remove the GitHub subset of the SlimPajama and\\nonly sample code data from the Starcoderdata.\\nAfter combining these two corpora, we have approximately 950 billion tokens for pre-training in total.Document 2:::\\nonly sample code data from the Starcoderdata.\\nAfter combining these two corpora, we have approximately 950 billion tokens for pre-training in total.\\nTinyLlama is trained on these tokens for approximately three epochs, as observed by Muennighoff\\net al. (2023), where training on data repeated for up to four epochs results in minimal performance\\ndegradation compared to using unique data. During training, we sample the natural language data to\\nachieve a ratio of around 7:3 between natural language data and code data.\\n2.2 Architecture\\nWe adopt a similar model architecture to Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b). We use a Transformer\\narchitecture based on Vaswani et al. (2017) with the following details:\\n2Table 1: The details of model architecture\\nHidden size Intermediate Hidden Size Context Len Heads Layers Vocab size\\n2,048 5,632 2,048 16 22 32,000\\nPositional embedding We use RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding) (Su et al., 2021) to inject\\npositional information into our model. RoPE is a widely adopted method recently used by many\\nmainstream large language models, such as PaLM (Anil et al., 2023), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023a),\\nand Qwen (Bai et al., 2023).\\nRMSNorm In pre-normalization, to attain a more stable training, we normalize the input before\\neach transformer sub-layer. In addition, we apply RMSNorm (Zhang and Sennrich, 2019) as our\\nnormalization technique, which can improve training efficiency.\\nSwiGLU Instead of using the traditional ReLU non-linearity, we follow Llama 2 and combine\\nSwish and Gated Linear Unit together, which is referred to as SwiGLU (Shazeer, 2020), as our\\nactivation function in TinyLlama.\\nGrouped-query Attention To reduce memory bandwidth overhead and speed up inference, we use\\ngrouped-query attention (Ainslie et al., 2023) in our model. We have 32 heads for query attention\\nand use 4 groups of key-value heads. With this technique, the model can share key and value\\nrepresentations across multiple heads without sacrificing much performance.Document 3:::\\nmance of Pythia-1.4B is also included in the figure for comparison.\\nProblem-solving evaluation We also evaluate TinyLlama’s problem-solving capabilities using the\\nInstructEval benchmark (Chia et al., 2023). This benchmark includes the following tasks:\\n•Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) (Hendrycks et al., 2021): This task is\\nused to measure a model’s world knowledge and problem-solving capabilities across various\\nsubjects. We evaluate the models in a 5-shot setting.\\n•BIG-Bench Hard (BBH) (Suzgun et al., 2023): This is a subset of 23 challenging tasks from\\nthe BIG-Bench benchmark (Srivastava et al., 2022) designed to measure a language model’s\\nabilities in complex instruction following. The models are evaluated in a 3-shot setting.\\n•Discrete Reasoning Over Paragraphs (DROP) (Dua et al., 2019): This reading comprehen-\\nsion task measures a model’s math reasoning abilities. We evaluate the models in a 3-shot\\nsetting.\\n•HumanEval (Zheng et al., 2023): This task is used to measure a model’s programming\\ncapabilities. The models are evaluated in a zero-shot setting.\\nThe evaluation results are presented in Table 3. We observe that TinyLlama demonstrates better\\nproblem-solving skills compared to existing models.\\nTable 3: Performance of problem-solving tasks on the InstructEval Benchmark.\\nMMLU BBH HumanEval DROP Avg.\\n5-shot 3-shot 0-shot 3-shot\\nPythia-1.0B 25.70 28.19 01.83 04.25 14.99\\nPythia-1.4B 25.41 29.01 04.27 12.27 17.72\\nTinyLlama-1.1B 25.34 29.65 09.15 15.34 19.87\\n5In our initial dataset preprocessing, we inadvertently over-inserted end-of-sequence (EOS) tokens.

Our model checkpoints and code are publicly available on GitHub at\\nhttps://github.com/jzhang38/TinyLlama .\\n1 Introduction\\nRecent progress in natural language processing (NLP) has been largely propelled by scaling up\\nlanguage model sizes (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023a,b). Large\\nLanguage Models (LLMs) pre-trained on extensive text corpora have demonstrated their effectiveness\\non a wide range of tasks (OpenAI, 2023; Touvron et al., 2023b). Some empirical studies demonstrated\\nemergent abilities in LLMs, abilities that may only manifest in models with a sufficiently large number\\nof parameters, such as few-shot prompting (Brown et al., 2020) and chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei\\net al., 2022). Other studies focus on modeling the scaling behavior of LLMs (Kaplan et al., 2020;\\nHoffmann et al., 2022). Hoffmann et al. (2022) suggest that, to train a compute-optimal model, the\\nsize of the model and the amount of training data should be increased at the same rate. This provides\\na guideline on how to optimally select the model size and allocate the amount of training data when\\nthe compute budget is fixed.Document 5:::\\nWe build our framework based on lit-gpt.3In adhering to Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), we employ\\nan autoregressive language modeling objective during the pretraining phase.

Additionally, we use a cosine learning rate schedule with maximum learning rate as\\n4.0×10−4and minimum learning rate as 4.0×10−5. We use 2,000 warmup steps to facilitate\\noptimized learning.4We set the batch size as 2M tokens. We assign weight decay as 0.1, and use\\na gradient clipping threshold of 1.0 to regulate the gradient value. We pretrain TinyLlama with 16\\nA100-40G GPUs in our project.\\n3 Results\\nWe evaluate TinyLlama on a wide range of commonsense reasoning and problem-solving tasks and\\ncompare it with several existing open-source language models with similar model parameters.\\nBaseline models We primarily focus on language models with a decoder-only architecture, compris-\\ning approximately 1 billion parameters. Specifically, we compare TinyLlama with OPT-1.3B (Zhang\\net al., 2022), Pythia-1.0B, and Pythia-1.4B (Biderman et al., 2023).\\nCommonsense reasoning tasks To understand the commonsense reasoning ability of TinyLlama,\\nwe consider the following tasks: Hellaswag (Zellers et al., 2019), OpenBookQA (Mihaylov et al.,\\n2018), WinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021), ARC-Easy and ARC-Challenge (Clark et al., 2018),\\nBoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), and PIQA (Bisk et al., 2020). We adopt the Language Model Evaluation\\nHarness framework (Gao et al., 2023) to evaluate the models. Following previous practice (Biderman\\net al., 2023), the models are evaluated in a zero-shot setting on these tasks. The results are presentedDocument 6:::\\net al., 2023), the models are evaluated in a zero-shot setting on these tasks. The results are presented\\nin Table 2.

Instead of training compute-optimal language\\nmodels, Touvron et al. (2023a) highlight the importance of the inference budget, instead of focusing\\nsolely on training compute-optimal language models. Inference-optimal language models aim for\\noptimal performance within specific inference constraints This is achieved by training models with\\nmore tokens than what is recommended by the scaling law (Hoffmann et al., 2022). Touvron et al.\\n(2023a) demonstrates that smaller models, when trained with more data, can match or even outperform\\ntheir larger counterparts. Also, Thaddée (2023) suggest that existing scaling laws (Hoffmann et al.,\\n2022) may not predict accurately in situations where smaller models are trained for longer periods.\\nMotivated by these new findings, this work focuses on exploring the behavior of smaller models\\nwhen trained with a significantly larger number of tokens than what is suggested by the scaling\\nlaw (Hoffmann et al., 2022). Specifically, we train a Transformer decoder-only model (Vaswani et al.,\\n2017) with 1.1B parameters using approximately 3 trillion tokens. To our knowledge, this is the\\nfirst attempt to train a model with 1B parameters using such a large amount of data. Following the\\nsame architecture and tokenizer as Llama 2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), we name our model TinyLlama.\\nTinyLlama shows competitive performance compared to existing open-source language models of\\nsimilar sizes. Specifically, TinyLlama surpasses both OPT-1.3B (Zhang et al., 2022) and Pythia-\\n1.4B (Biderman et al., 2023) in various downstream tasks.Document 8:::\\ncontrol and avoiding catastrophic forgetting that is prevalent in conventional approaches.\\nCorrespondence to Rachit and Bidisha: [brachit, bidishasamanta]@google.com\\n1arXiv:2401.02412v1  [cs.LG]  4 Jan 2024mBmA\\nTranslate from XX to En:\\n<Source XX Sentence>Everything but the kitchen sink\\nLow -resource\\nLanguage \\nPre-trained\\nWhat does this Python code do?\\n<Python Code Snippet>Implements the classic word \\ngame of Hangman\\nm BKey-value \\nMapping\\nx1 = 10\\n     \\nxn = 2x1 = 10\\n     \\nxn = 2\\nm A\\nlA,ilA,i lB,jlB,(j+1)\\nWKWVWQAttention\\nWhat is the value of x 1 + x 8 * xn?Since x 1=10, x 8=14, x n=2, x 1 + x 8 * xn = 38\\nmBmAPre-trained \\non GitHubNumeric Arithmetic\\nFigure 1: Overview of CALM.

We conduct a set of ablations of our framework to identify which factors play\\nkey roles. We evaluate two model variants trained differently than our model: No Retriever trains an\\nLM using the standard instruction-following method given instruction-output pairs, without retrieved\\npassages; No Critic trains an LM trained with input-output pairs that are always augmented with the\\ntop one retrieved document without reflection tokens. This is similar to SAIL (Luo et al., 2023), and\\nwe use our instruction-output data instead of using the Alpaca dataset (Dubois et al., 2023), as in\\nSAIL. We also conduct ablation on our inference-time algorithm, including No retrieval disables\\nretrieval during inference; Hard constraints indicates the model performance that retrieves when\\nRetrieve =Yes instead of using the adaptive threshold; Retrieve top 1 always retrieves and uses the\\ntop one document only, similar to standard RAG approaches; Remove ISSUPindicates the model\\nperformance that removes ISSUPscore only during critique-guided beam search in Eq. 4. In this\\nablation experiment, we use a training instance size of 50k for a more efficient exploration of trainingDocument 2:::\\nfactual accuracy (Min et al., 2023), we aim for the model to retrieve passages more frequently to\\nensure that the output aligns closely with the available evidence. Conversely, in more open-ended\\ntasks, like composing a personal experience essay, the emphasis shifts towards retrieving less and\\nprioritizing the overall creativity or utility score. In this section, we describe approaches to enforce\\ncontrol to meet these distinct objectives during the inference process.\\nAdaptive retrieval with threshold. SELF-RAGdynamically decides when to retrieve text passages by\\npredicting Retrieve . Alternatively, our framework allows a threshold to be set. Specifically, if the prob-\\nability of generating the Retrieve =Yes token normalized over all output tokens in Retrieve surpasses a\\ndesignated threshold, we trigger retrieval (details in Appendix Section A.3).\\nTree-decoding with critique tokens.

However, there are also some limitations\\nsuch as unstable performance in low-shot settings,\\nand the fact that providing more in-context examples\\ndoes not consistently improve performance.\\nTo learn a better retriever and enhance the bidirec-\\ntional understanding ability of the reader, as demon-\\nstrated in Izacard et al. (2023), a practical choice is to\\npretrain the model with the masked language mod-\\neling objective, where the input is a corrupted text\\nwith several masked spans placed randomly within\\nthe sequence (refer to Figure 1 (left) for an example).\\nHowever, in testing, based on our analysis in §3.1\\nand Appendix C.1, it is most effective to place the tar-\\nget question after all the in-context examples, with a\\nmasked token (i.e., <extra id0>) following the ques-\\ntion (Figure 1, middle)). Thus, there exists a mismatch between pretraining and inference.\\nTo solve this issue, we propose combining retrieval-augmented masked and prefix language\\nmodeling. Specifically, in the first stage, the retriever and reader are trained jointly with\\nretrieval-augmented masked language modeling. The training objective for the retriever is\\nto minimize the KL divergence KL(pREADER ∥pRETRIEVER )between the passage posterior\\ndistribution according to the reader and the passage distribution from the retriever over\\nthe top-K retrieved passages, i.e., pREADER (d) =exp(logpLM(a|d,q))\\n∑K\\ni=1exp(logpLM(a|di,q)),pRETRIEVER (d) =\\nexp(s(d,q)/T)\\n∑K\\ni=1exp(s(di,q)/T), where s(·)calculates the dot product between the query qand passage d\\nvectors, and Tis a hyperparameter. The training objective for the reader is to maximize the\\nlikelihood of the masked spans with nretrieved passages: ∑ilogp(ai|q,{dk}1,...,n,a1:i−1).\\nIn the second stage, for each sequence, we mask 10% of the tokens on average at the end of\\nthe sequence with the <extra id0>token. Then, we use the retriever obtained from the first\\n5In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language ModelsDocument 8:::\\n6In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 8>8\\n# In-Context Examples2628303234Natural Questions, EM\\nRAVEN 11B\\n + FICL\\nATLAS 11B\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 8>8\\n# In-Context Examples56586062646668TriviaQA, EM\\nFigure 5: RAVEN vsATLAS .

Following the setup in §3.1, we first evaluate on two widely-used open-domain\\nquestion answering datasets: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and Trivi-\\naQA (Joshi et al., 2017). Additionally, we conduct a case study on long-form question\\nanswering using the ELI5 dataset (Fan et al., 2019). Furthermore, we assess the models’\\nlanguage understanding ability using the Massively Multitask Language Understanding\\n(MMLU) benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021). Detailed information regarding the MMLU\\nevaluation is in Appendix B.5. Other evaluation settings are the same as §B.1.\\nBaselines. Since both RAVEN and ATLAS (Izacard et al., 2023) are trained starting from T5,\\nwe choose ATLAS as a primary baseline for comparison. We also compare our model with\\ndecoder-only LLMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), and\\nLLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) (in a closed-book setting). Additionally, for open-domain\\nQA, we evaluate our approach against REPLUG (Shi et al., 2023) and RETRO (Borgeaud\\net al., 2022), as well as its improved version RETRO ++(Wang et al., 2023). These models are\\ndecoder-only language models augmented with retrieval.

In contrast, the second category of baselines with retrievals, including REPLUG and RETRO, are decoder-only language models augmented with retrieval during both training and inference. These models use a retriever to select relevant passages from a large corpus during training and decode the output sequence conditioned on both the input sequence and the selected passages. The key difference between these two categories is the integration of retrieval during training versus only during inference.   \n",

These models have demonstrated remarkable\\nperformance across a wide range of tasks (Qin et al., 2023; Bubeck et al., 2023; Huang &\\nChang, 2023). One of the key features that enables these models to excel is their ability to\\nperform in-context learning (Dong et al., 2022). By conditioning on given context, LLMs canDocument 3:::\\nWhile there has been some research on in-context learning with retrieval-augmented\\ndecoder-only LMs, which can be straightforwardly implemented by concatenating retrieved\\npassages with the query as the input of the LM (Mallen et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2023; Khattab\\net al., 2022), in-context learning with retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder LMs remains\\nunexplored to the best of our knowledge. This is despite the fact that encoder-decoder LMs\\ncan be more efficient at incorporating multiple (e.g., 40) retrieved passages.\\n1RAVEN , a bird known for its intelligence and adaptability, has the letters “RA” in its name, which\\nrepresents “ Retrieval- Augmented” in our context.\\n2In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language ModelsDocument 4:::\\nmay be attributed to two factors: 1) the sequence length constraints during pretraining,\\nwhere the maximum input length to the encoder is set to 384 tokens, and the average input\\nsequence length (excluding passages) is around 130 tokens; 2) the model’s ability to learn\\nadequately with 5 or 8 examples, making additional examples less beneficial.\\nIn Appendices C.1 and C.2, we also study the effect of the target question’s position and the\\neffect of the number of retrieved passages. We observe that positioning the target question\\nafter all the in-context examples yields the optimal performance. Additionally, for both\\n0-shot and 5-shot settings, the performance of the models increases significantly with the\\nnumber of retrieved passages, with the 5-shot performance consistently outperforming the\\n0-shot setting. This highlights the superiority of the encoder-decoder (Fusion-in-Decoder)\\narchitecture, which offers an advantage not available to decoder-only language models.\\n3.2 R AVEN : Combining Retrieval-Augmented Masked and Prefix Language Modeling\\nInputtoEncoder:Machinelearningalgorithmsbuildamodelbasedonsampledata,knownastrainingdata,inordertomakepredictionsordecisionswithoutbeingexplicitlyprogrammedtodoso.Machinelearningalgorithmsareusedinawidevarietyofapplications,suchasinmedicine,emailfiltering,speechrecognition,agriculture,andcomputervision,whereitisdifficultor<extra_id_0>Passage:…machinelearningmodelsrequireahighquantityofreliabledatainorderforthemodels…InputtoDecoder:NoneOutput:<extra_id_0>unfeasibletodevelopconventionalalgorithmstoperformtheneededtasks.   ��������������������������������������������\\nFigure 3: Retrieval-augmented prefix\\nlanguage modeling.In§3.1, we observe that retrieval-augmented\\nencoder-decoder LMs exhibit a certain ability for in-\\ncontext learning, which has been overlooked in previ-\\nous studies.

Building upon the analysis, we develop models\\nwith enhanced zero-shot performance and improved in-context learning abilities.\\n3.1 In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder LMs\\nTo investigate the in-context learning ability of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder\\nlanguage models, we first aim to gain insights from the state-of-the-art designs in the\\nliterature. Among them, the design of ATLAS (Izacard et al., 2023) stands out; it combines\\na general-purpose dense retriever with a sequence-to-sequence reader (i.e., T5 (Raffel et al.,\\n2020)) using the Fusion-in-Decoder architecture (Izacard & Grave, 2021). The retriever,\\nencoder and decoder are jointly trained during the pretraining process. In this process,\\nthe dense retriever, based on the Contriever model (Izacard et al., 2022), is responsible\\nfor selecting relevant passages from an external knowledge source, e.g., Wikipedia, based\\non the given corrupted context. The retrieved passages are then processed along with the\\ncontext by the encoder, which generates the corresponding output, i.e., the masked spans,\\nat the decoder (Figure 1, left). ATLAS demonstrates exceptional few-shot performance on\\nknowledge-intensive language tasks (Petroni et al., 2021), despite having a lower parameter\\ncount compared to other recent LLMs.\\nHowever, in Izacard et al. (2023), the few-shot performance is achieved by finetuning\\nthe model with few-shot examples, which requires additional training and may limit its\\napplications, such as dealing with dynamic and diverse real-time user queries like GPT-\\n3/4 (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023), where in-context learning plays a vital role. Therefore,\\nwe take the initiative to explore the in-context learning ability of this type of models, usingDocument 6:::\\nfrom an external corpus. Among these, the encoder-decoder models, such as ATLAS (Izacard\\net al., 2023), stand out. They benefit from the strong representation ability of a bidirectional\\nencoder, coupled with of the efficacy of a Fusion-in-Decoder architecture (Izacard & Grave,\\n2021), enabling the effective integration of multiple retrieved passages. Despite these\\nadvancements, in-context learning with these models remains underexplored.\\nIn this regard, we first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art retrieval-\\naugmented encoder-decoder language models by designing and experimenting with differ-\\nent prompting strategies. We find that these models exhibit a certain in-context learning\\nability; however, due to a mismatch between pretraining and inference and a limited context\\nlength—issues that are common to existing encoder-decoder LMs trained with masked\\nlanguage modeling—its few-shot performance is not stable and providing more than, e.g.,\\n8-shot, examples does not lead to further improvement.\\nBased on the analysis, we develop RAVEN1by first mitigating the mismatch between\\npretraining and inference through a combination of retrieval-augmented masked language\\nmodeling and prefix language modeling. Moreover, to enable the model to learn from more\\nin-context examples, we propose Fusion-in-Context Learning , a novel approach that allows\\nthe model to utilize more in-context examples without modifying the model configuration\\nor requiring additional training. Furthermore, we suggest using the retriever of the model to\\nobtain relevant in-context examples to further enhance few-shot performance. Our empirical\\nresults demonstrate that RAVEN significantly outperforms previous retrieval-augmented\\nencoder-decoder LMs in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, even achieving comparable\\nresults to decoder-only LLMs in some settings despite having 180 times fewer parameters.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are twofold:Document 7:::\\nresults to decoder-only LLMs in some settings despite having 180 times fewer parameters.\\nThe main contributions of this paper are twofold:\\n•From an analytical standpoint, we provide a thorough analysis of the in-context learning\\nability of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language models.

These models typically employ\\nan information retrieval mechanism to access relevant information from a large corpus,\\nwhich is then integrated into the model’s prediction process. Retrieval-augmented LMs\\ncan be based on both encoder-decoder (Izacard et al., 2023; Lewis et al., 2020) and decoder-\\nonly (Khandelwal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Shi et al., 2022) architectures. For\\ndecoder-only LMs, the computational cost typically increases quadratically with the input\\nlength, as well as with the number of retrieval passages. In contrast, for encoder-decoder\\nLMs with a Fusion-in-Decoder architecture, the computation cost grows linearly with the\\nnumber of retrieved passages, as they only perform self-attention over one passage at a\\ntime (Izacard & Grave, 2021). This concept is also investigated by Ye et al. (2023) for more\\nefficient in-context learning.\\nWhile there has been some research on in-context learning with retrieval-augmented\\ndecoder-only LMs, which can be straightforwardly implemented by concatenating retrievedDocument 8:::\\n6In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 8>8\\n# In-Context Examples2628303234Natural Questions, EM\\nRAVEN 11B\\n + FICL\\nATLAS 11B\\n0 1 2 3 4 5 8>8\\n# In-Context Examples56586062646668TriviaQA, EM\\nFigure 5: RAVEN vsATLAS .

Without\\nthis, users would need to manually provide in-context examples; and 2) optimize the\\nselection of in-context examples, thereby improving in-context learning performance.\\n4 Experiments\\n4.1 Experimental Setup\\nDatasets. Following the setup in §3.1, we first evaluate on two widely-used open-domain\\nquestion answering datasets: Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) and Trivi-\\naQA (Joshi et al., 2017). Additionally, we conduct a case study on long-form question\\nanswering using the ELI5 dataset (Fan et al., 2019). Furthermore, we assess the models’\\nlanguage understanding ability using the Massively Multitask Language Understanding\\n(MMLU) benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021). Detailed information regarding the MMLU\\nevaluation is in Appendix B.5. Other evaluation settings are the same as §B.1.\\nBaselines. Since both RAVEN and ATLAS (Izacard et al., 2023) are trained starting from T5,\\nwe choose ATLAS as a primary baseline for comparison. We also compare our model with\\ndecoder-only LLMs such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2023), and\\nLLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) (in a closed-book setting). Additionally, for open-domain\\nQA, we evaluate our approach against REPLUG (Shi et al., 2023) and RETRO (Borgeaud\\net al., 2022), as well as its improved version RETRO ++(Wang et al., 2023). These models are\\ndecoder-only language models augmented with retrieval. REPLUG is based on Codex (ChenDocument 9:::\\nEffect of Number of In-Context Examples. The number of in-context examples is a crucial\\nhyperparameter for in-context learning. Generally, we expect better performance from a\\nmodel with more in-context examples, but there is an upper limit due to 1) the maximum con-\\ntext length setup, e.g., 512 tokens, during the pretraining process, and 2) the point at which\\nthe model has received sufficient examples and cannot gain additional information from\\nmore examples. The optimal number of in-context examples also varies between models.\\nFor instance, on TriviaQA, PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2023) exhibits better 1-shot performance\\nthan settings with more examples, while this is not the case for GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020).\\n3Experimental setup is detailed in the Appendix B.1.\\n4In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models\\nFigure 2 illustrates the impact of varying the number of in-context examples across different\\nmodel sizes. Interestingly, the 11B model demonstrates poor performance in low-shot\\nsettings, e.g., 1-shot, but improves significantly after 4-shot and 5-shot. Upon examining the\\ngenerated responses, we find that the model tends to produce answers with more tokens\\nin low-shot settings, while the ground truth typically consists of shorter answers with\\nfewer than 5 tokens. By relaxing the criteria for a correct prediction to include instances\\nwhere the ground-truth answer is a substring of the model output, we find that the 1-shot\\nperformance surpasses that of the 0-shot setting (38.3 vs 32.1 on NQ).\\nAll models perform well in the 5-shot and 8-shot settings, but their performance does not\\ncontinue to improve with more in-context examples (e.g., 16-shot). We believe this plateau\\nmay be attributed to two factors: 1) the sequence length constraints during pretraining,\\nwhere the maximum input length to the encoder is set to 384 tokens, and the average input\\n---\\nNow here is the question you need to answer.\\n\\nQuestion: How effective are prompting strategies for in-context learning in encoder-decoder language models?\\n\\n\\n</s>\\n<|assistant|>\\nIn the context of in-context learning for encoder-decoder language models, prompting strategies have been identified as a crucial factor for effective performance. Two prompting strategies have been proposed: Strategy 1 involves feeding all example question-answer pairs and the target question to the encoder, without any input to the decoder. Strategy 2 feeds the same input as Strategy 1, but also includes the target question as input to the decoder. The paper \"In-Context Learning with Retrieval-Augmented Encoder-Decoder Language Models\" by Jie Huang et al. (2023) explores the in-context learning ability of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder language models and proposes a new model called RAVEN (Retrieval-Augmented VEner) to enhance zero-shot performance and improve in-context learning abilities. The paper also suggests Fusion-in-Context Learning and In-Context Example Retrieval strategies to enable the model to utilize more in-context examples without additional training or modifying the model configuration. Experimental results show that RAVEN significantly outperforms previous retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder LMs in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, despite having substantially fewer parameters. The paper highlights the potential of retrieval-augmented encoder-decoder LMs for in-context learning and encourages further research in this direction.   \n",
